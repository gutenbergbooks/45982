  <h2 id='chI' class='c002'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />ON A RAID.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Submerge to five fathoms, Mr. Templeton!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The speaker was Lord Hastings, commander of
the British submarine D-17.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack Templeton, a British youth and first officer
of the under-sea craft, repeated the command for
which he had been waiting now for some moments.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Chadwick!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings’ voice again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>A third figure, standing upon the bridge—now
enclosed as the submarine sank from the surface—came
to attention before his commander. Frank
Chadwick, an American youth and second officer
of the vessel, awaited instructions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everything shipshape?” questioned his commander
sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir. Engine-room trouble all repaired,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lookout posted forward?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well. Ten fathoms, Mr. Templeton!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings turned from the periscope,
through which he had been peering, and for a moment
gazed thoughtfully at his two young officers
before speaking. At last he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unless something goes wrong we will be in Heligoland
within two hours!”</p>

<p class='c004'>A startling statement, this, to one who did not
know the nature of the man who made it; for it
was a fact known to all the world that Heligoland,
the great German fortress that guarded the approach
to the few miles of German seacoast, was
one of the strongest in the world—perhaps as well
fortified as Gibraltar itself, and considered by naval
experts equally as impregnable.</p>

<p class='c004'>Apparently the D-17 was bent upon a perilous
venture.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such, indeed, was the case. The D-17, sister
ship to the D-16, in which Lord Hastings and his
two young officers had seen many exciting adventures,
as related in “<span class='sc'>The Boy Allies with the
Terror of the Seas</span>,” had left the coast of England
the day before, heading straight for the
strongly fortified German base; and now she was
almost there.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just what object Lord Hastings had in view
neither Jack nor Frank knew, for Lord Hastings
had not yet taken them fully into his confidence
concerning this expedition. Since leaving England
he had been busy in his cabin almost continuously
poring over papers and maps, but both lads had
a pretty shrewd idea that the venture was an important
one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Frank asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what are we going to do in there, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What would be your idea about that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, “there are several things we
might do. First, we might sink a couple of German
war vessels. We might try and learn the lay of the
land—perhaps I should say the water—or we might
try and get ashore and so learn other matters of
importance. Have I hit it, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have,” returned his commander dryly;
“you’ve hit it in more ways than one. In fact, I
may say you have guessed shrewdly all through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I can do a little guessing, too,” declared
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?” said Lord Hastings inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack, “we first shall probably make
an attempt to get ashore, for there we can learn
more than we could reconnoitering beneath the
water. That’s where we shall try to find our information.
And we shall sink a couple of the enemy
on our way out. Am I right, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are,” replied Lord Hastings briefly, and
turning on his heel he left the bridge and disappeared
in his cabin, only to reappear a few moments
later, charts and papers in his hands, announcing:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Chadwick, you will take the wheel yourself.
I’ll stand beside you and give my orders. These
waters are thickly strewn with mines and we can
afford to take no chances.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank obeyed this command without question
and Lord Hastings took his place beside him, first
remarking to Jack:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will relieve the lookout forward, Mr. Templeton,
and keep your eyes open. I need not mention
the need of prompt action should you perceive
danger ahead. Slow down to five knots!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack saluted, and after giving the command that
reduced the speed of the vessel, took himself forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>There, at the extreme bow, he relieved a sailor
and took the watch himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the D-17, like her sister ship the D-16,
which had been sunk off the Dardanelles—an accident
in which all on board escaped as by a miracle—was
as unlike other under-water craft as day is
from night.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the first place, she was able to remain under
water indefinitely. It was not necessary for her
to return to the surface every so often to replenish
her air tanks, for she carried no tanks. The D-17
generated her air supply from the water, by means
of a secret process known only to high officials of
the British admiralty. Also, the D-17 was the last
word in submarine craft in other respects. She
had a speed of more than thirty knots when submerged,
could move along even faster upon the surface
of the water, and her bow, a solid piece of substantial glass,
in which reposed a huge searchlight,
made it possible for her to pick her course under
the water—something that no other submarine craft
was able to do. For this latter reason she could
venture places where no other vessel would dare.</p>

<p class='c004'>The huge light flashing in front now, Jack took
his stand and stood with eyes straining into the
distance ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>And while the D-17 is thus moving toward the
strongest fortification of the enemy, a few words
concerning the two subordinate officers aboard are
necessary.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank Chadwick, an American youth of some
seventeen years of age, found himself in his present
position as a result of a series of strange happenings.
He had lost his father in Italy immediately
after the outbreak of the great war, and
while hunting him in Naples, had been shanghaied
aboard an Italian schooner. Here, following a mutiny
of the crew and the death of the captain, he
found himself a prisoner, remaining so until released
by Jack Templeton.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter’s appearance came about in this manner:
Jack, the son of an Englishman, nevertheless
had spent most of his life in a little African coast
town. His father died there and Jack found himself
sole owner of a little store, which had almost
a native trade alone, though an occasional ship put
in for supplies.</p>

<p class='c004'>One day a schooner hove in sight. A boat put
over the side and its occupants obtained provisions
at Jack’s store. In the lad’s absence, they departed
without making payment. Jack hurried after them
to collect and climbed aboard the schooner just as
she raised anchor. A fight followed his demand
for payment. By some resourcefulness and some
good hard fighting, the lad succeeded in gaining
the upper hand. Then he released Frank, whom
he found a prisoner with another, a British secret
service agent.</p>

<p class='c004'>A series of subsequent events threw the lads into
the company of Lord Hastings, who, taking a liking
to them, answered their pleas to be made sailors
by securing them commissions and taking them
aboard his own ship at the opening of the great
world war.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then had followed months of excitement and
adventure. They had taken part in British successes
and reverses on all the seven seas. They had
been “in at the death” in the first British naval victory
off Heligoland; they had followed the German
cruiser <i>Emden</i>, “the Terror of the Sea”; they had
been in action with the British fleet that destroyed
the German squadron off the Falkland Islands in
the western hemisphere; they had seen action in
other parts of the globe—at the Dardanelles, with
the Japanese at Tsingchau, with the French in the
Adriatic and with the Russians in the Baltic.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a word, they were veterans.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many were the narrow escapes they had had,
but they had always survived. Their latest venture
had almost cost Frank his life, for, after the
submarine upon which they sailed had been destroyed,
Frank engaged in a death struggle with
a British traitor in the waters of the North Sea
and had won by a scant fraction. He was unconscious
when rescued by his chum and he had remained
inactive, as had the others, in England for
several weeks.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now, the D-17 having been put in service,
Lord Hastings had been named to command her
and all were eager to get busy again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank, though sturdy and strong, was by no
means a match for his chum, a powerful and husky
young Englishman. Also he was naturally more
hot-headed than his friend, and given to taking
foolhardy chances—at times. Jack’s coolness had
saved both more than once.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack was what Frank called a real fighter and
had proved his mettle more than once since the two
had been together. Strong as an ox, he was a bad
customer to tackle in a rough and tumble and he
was exceedingly proficient in the use of his fists.
Also he was a fair swordsman and a fair shot.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was in the latter accomplishment that Frank
excelled. He was a dead shot with either rifle or
revolver, as he had proved in several tight situations
where straight shooting had been necessary.
He had never failed in this respect.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fortunately, both lads spoke German and French
as well as English, and under Lord Hastings’ tutoring,
they had also picked up a smattering of Italian,
Russian and Hungarian—not much, perhaps, but
enough to carry on a conversation, although with
some difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the time the D-17 made her way toward Heligoland,
the great war was almost at a standstill.
It seemed that the warring nations had reached a
deadlock that could not be broken.</p>

<p class='c004'>On sea, of course, the Allies held the whip hand,
except for the submarine warfare instigated by the
Central Powers. This, however, due in a measure
to the activities of British under-sea craft upon
which Jack and Frank had served, had been somewhat
lessened lately and German U-boats, as they
had come to be known, had not been so active recently.</p>

<p class='c004'>On land, however, it seemed that neither side had
gained much in the last few months. What
advantage there was seemed to have rested with the
Germans, for the Kaiser’s mighty drive through
the Balkans had completely crushed heroic little
Serbia and had opened a path to Constantinople
for the German hordes. Also it had brought Bulgaria
into the war on the side of the Central Powers,
giving them the armed weight necessary to keep
Greece and Roumania from throwing their support
to the Allies, much as they would have liked
to do so.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was the situation, then, when the D-17
steamed slowly toward the German naval fortress
of Heligoland.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Lord Hastings, standing by Frank at the
wheel, gave the course, avoiding mines as well as
he could by the chart that had somehow come into
his possession, Jack retained his place forward in
the glass-like cage, his eyes steadily ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>For an hour, perhaps, he sat there, seeing nothing
that indicated danger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, suddenly, his right hand shot out, his finger
touched a little push-button; the throb of the engines
ceased as if by magic and the D-17 seemed to
halt in her track.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack approached Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mine, sir,” he said, quietly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />WITHIN THE FORTRESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Good work, Jack,” said Frank, approvingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you advise?” asked Lord Hastings.
“Up or down?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Depends on the depth, sir,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have a look at the chart,” said Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>He spread it out before him and the three pored
over it for several moments.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here you are, sir,” said Frank, at last, placing a
finger on the chart.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Plenty of water,” was Lord Hastings’ comment.
“Submerge another five fathoms, Mr. Templeton.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack gave the order and then returned to his
post.</p>

<p class='c004'>The D-17 submerged another five fathoms and
proceeded at a snail’s pace. Jack kept his eyes
glued to the course ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later the vibrations of the engine
ceased. Then Jack made his way aft to where Lord
Hastings and Frank were conversing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unless I am badly off in my calculations,” said
Lord Hastings, “we should now be able to come
to the surface beyond the mine field.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And as soon as we do, some German warship
will send us to the bottom,” remarked Frank dryly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So they will—if they see us,” returned his commander.
“We must make it a point that they do
not see us. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All very well, sir,” said Jack, “but if we go up
now they are sure to see us—and they won’t mistake
us for one of themselves this time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings smiled quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then we won’t go up now,” he replied as he
looked at his watch and noted that it was half past
five. “It’ll be dark in less than an hour. We’ll
remain here until then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This ended the conversation and the commander
of the D-17 went to his cabin, leaving Jack in command.</p>

<p class='c004'>The time passed slowly, but darkness came at
last; and with its coming Lord Hastings emerged
from his cabin, attired in the uniform of a German
lieutenant-commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I forgot to tell you lads to don your German
uniforms,” he said. “I’ll wait now, but make
haste.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack hurried away in response to this
command and soon were attired in the full regalia
of German lieutenants. Lord Hastings eyed them
approvingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no use talking,” he said, “I have always
thought it—and I am sure of it now—both of you
would make first-class Germans. You may give
the command to come to the surface, Mr. Templeton.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A few moments later the D-17 rode gently upon
the calm sea within the fortifications of Heligoland,
the greatest German military fortresses, and considered
among the strongest and most impregnable
in the world.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was very dark and the night was perfectly still
when the three forms ascended the ladder and
emerged from the conning tower to the bridge—open
now that the submarine was above water. A
fourth figure followed them, that of Price, an aged
British tar, whom Lord Hastings had designated to
take command in their absence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t forget now, Price,” said Lord Hastings
sternly, “you will submerge immediately we have
put off and on no account will you come to the
surface again until 9 o’clock to-morrow night.
Then you will rise in exactly this spot—and be
sure that you are on time. Do I make myself
clear?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly, sir,” replied Price, saluting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. Then launch the boat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This was done immediately and a few moments
later Lord Hastings, Jack and Frank were proceeding
rapidly shoreward, the engine of the small
motor-boat muffled so that all that could be heard
was the faint sound of the exhaust.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the darkness, as they sped on, loomed great,
dark shapes—the forms of some of the most powerful
of the Kaiser’s formidable sea fighters. Smoke
poured from their funnels and faint lights glowed
aboard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ready for action at any moment,” said Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So they are,” agreed Frank. “Great Scott!
It doesn’t seem possible that so many of these great
craft could be afraid to venture forth to give battle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, it doesn’t,” declared Jack. “But at the same
time, you must remember there are more and still
more formidable craft waiting for them to come out
and try it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s true, too,” admitted Frank. “I wish
they would try it, though. I don’t believe many
of them would get back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Evidently the Germans have the same belief—which
is the reason they haven’t tried it,” said Lord
Hastings, smiling in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Silence, now,” he cautioned them, after a moment.
“We are close to the shore. Let all further
talk be in German.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Five minutes later the motor-boat came to a long
pier, which extended far into the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here we are,” said Lord Hastings in German.
He glanced around. “Other boats tied up here.
Guess we might as well do the same,” he said. “We
may need it. Fortunately, at my suggestion, none
of the D-17’s boats bear a mark of identification.
Guess it won’t be bothered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The three climbed up on the pier and the boat
was made fast.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which way now, sir?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll just do a little prowling,” said Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned and was about to move off when there
came a gruff hail:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who goes there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Friend!” replied Lord Hastings, wheeling about
quickly and looking into the heavy-joweled face
of a German sentinel.</p>

<p class='c004'>The German eyed the three figures keenly; then,
apparently satisfied that they were all they seemed,
he brought his hand up in a stiff military salute.
The three passed on.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rather lax methods here, if you ask me,” said
Frank, when they were out of hearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Jack. “You must remember
that they feel perfectly secure. Evidently
they have no idea an enemy would venture within
this fortification.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some of them have ventured within ours,” returned
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just the egotism of the German, that’s all,” said
Lord Hastings. “They all believe they can do
things that no other man would even consider.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So they do,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack looked at his chum in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just what do you mean by that?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I was just thinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>, and a
few other things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s different,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>They continued their walk.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now they came to a brilliantly lighted street.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I didn’t know this was a regular city,” was
Frank’s comment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither is it,” returned Lord Hastings, “although
there are some few people living here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But look,” protested Frank, pointing, “those
are restaurants and cafés; and there are stores
and things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So there are,” returned his commander. “Must
have changed since I was here last. However, I
suppose it is because the garrison has to have some
form of entertainment. Guess the best thing we
can do is to go in one of these cafés and look about
a bit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He led the way, and just before entering the
brilliantly lighted doorway, paused long enough to
say in a low voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“No hesitation now. It would prove fatal. Walk
as if you owned the place—just as every German
does.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys needed no instructions along this line,
and they followed Lord Hastings with heads erect,
swaggering a trifle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Inside there was revelry. German officers sat
about tables that lined the four walls of the room.
With them, or some of them, were their wives.
Apparently it was the supper hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>At a far end of the room a string orchestra furnished
music and there were four singers—two
men and two women—or rather one young girl, for
such Frank perceived her to be after careful inspection.</p>

<p class='c004'>A courteous waiter met the three at the door as
they entered, and with many bows ushered them
to a table in a distant corner. They sat down and
Lord Hastings gave the order for supper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the music struck up a more lively gait and
some of the German officers and their wives arose
and danced in the center of the floor. Frank saw
a young German lieutenant, who apparently had
been drinking, approach the youthful singer. Apparently
he asked her to dance, for he indicated the
other whirling couples. But the girl shook her
head. Whereupon the young German muttered
something under his breath and took himself away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank found his eyes continually straying toward
the young girl; and once aware of his scrutiny, the
girl’s eyes also flashed in his direction more often
than was necessary. Jack noticed this, but said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>But there was something else that Jack noticed
as he ate. The young German who had so recently
been refused by the girl, had followed the direction
of her eyes and he now glared at Frank balefully.
Jack smiled to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the lad’s smile soon changed to a frown.</p>

<p class='c004'>After five minutes, the young German officer
again approached the girl and again asked her to
dance. He met a second refusal and this time
words ensued. The German seemed angry and
two of his companions approached and pulled him
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank had been a witness of this scene, as had
Jack and Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The big bully!” said Frank half aloud. “Just
because he wears a German uniform he thinks he
owns the earth. I would like to teach him a lesson.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t try it here,” said Lord Hastings quietly.
“Remember where we are and the position we are
in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I won’t, sir,” replied Frank. “But I don’t
like that fellow’s looks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t, eh?” said Jack. “Well, how about
the pretty singer. I notice you have been looking
that way quite often.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank’s face grew red.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She doesn’t look like a German to me,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, she doesn’t,” Jack agreed. “Still, she must
be or she wouldn’t be here. Besides, she hasn’t a
trace of accent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither have you and you are not German,” declared
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack would have replied, but his attention was
suddenly drawn again to the girl, who now seemed
to be making signals to catch Frank’s eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seems to want to talk to you,” said Jack, nudging
his chum slyly.</p>

<p class='c004'>At that moment the girl looked directly at Frank
and smiled. Then she motioned him to come to
her. Frank was greatly flustered. Not so Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’d better go. She probably wants you to
dance with her,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, you had better go, Frank,” said Lord Hastings.
“In the first place it would be impolite to
refuse, and besides, it might attract attention. Only
be careful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank, his face still red, hesitated a moment;
then rose to his feet.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />A WARNING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Now, Frank, attired in his German uniform,
made a handsome picture of a young officer and
many eyes were turned his way as he strode across
the floor. Particularly did the young German officer
with whom the singer had refused to dance
eye him, but his was not a gaze of admiration—it
was anger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings called Jack’s attention to this.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I’ve noticed it,” said Jack. “I’ll keep an
eye on him. Now I wonder what that girl wants
with Frank?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have as much an idea as I have,” was his
reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl arose from her seat as Frank approached.
She extended a hand, and, with the air
of a true cavalier, Frank bent low over it. Then,
as the music struck up, the girl smiled and would
have spoken, but Frank forestalled her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you dance?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded; and a moment later they were whirling
about the floor in an old-fashioned waltz.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus among the crowd there was a certain privacy
and Frank was moved to ask:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now will you not tell me why you signalled
me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Instantly the girl became serious, although she
continued to smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must be brief,” she said, “so listen closely. In
the first place you are not German. Oh, I knew it
the moment you came in,” she said hurriedly, as
Frank gave a start. “I wouldn’t have mentioned
it, but the young German officer whom I refused to
dance with also suspects. He said as much when
he noticed me looking at you. He said he would
catch you off your guard and force you to betray
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But——” Frank started to protest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, there is no use trying to fool me,” said the
girl. “I know you are not a German—an Englishman
perhaps, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank smiled at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; not an Englishman,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not French,” said the girl, looking up
at him. “Even though you speak German without
accent, I know you are not French, for I myself
am French and I would detect it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I am not French,” said Frank with another
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then what?” asked the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, “what would you say to an
American.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“An American!” exclaimed the girl. “Are you,
really? I am glad, for I have wanted to meet an
American.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Frank gave another start.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” he thought. “Suppose this girl
is fooling me? Suppose she has taken this means
of finding out who we are?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at her suspiciously. But the girl evidently
read his thoughts, for she looked at him
steadily and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I will not betray you. You need have no
fear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But if you are French,” said Frank, “what are
you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a long story,” said the girl, “and some day
I may tell you. But now I have not time. The
music will stop in a moment or two now, and you
must return to your friends. But I had to warn
you, for I know that Lieutenant Holzen is bent
on mischief. It would be well for you and your
friends to leave at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” said Frank, “but we are able to take
care of ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I know that,” responded the girl. “But I
know also that you would not be here except upon
some desperate mission and that you cannot afford
to jeopardize for the sake of a quarrel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are right, of course,” said Frank quietly.
“But tell me, what is my mission to you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing,” said the girl slowly, “only that—that
I would do anything for France.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She said it gravely and there could be no mistaking
her earnestness. Frank bowed his head in
reply; for there was nothing he could say.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several times more they whirled about the room;
and then Frank bethought himself to ask the girl
who she was.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you tell me your name?” he asked. “I
am Lieutenant Chadwick of His British Majesty’s
service.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl smiled and would have replied, but at
that moment the music ceased. Frank offered her
his arm and led her back to her seat and there was
no further opportunity for the girl to reply to the
lad’s last question. As she resumed her seat, Frank
bowed once more, then turned on his heel and
strode back to his own table, where Lord Hastings
and Jack were awaiting him eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, fair charmer,” Jack greeted him.
“How——”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank silenced his chum with a gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is a serious business,” he said quietly and
told the others what the girl had said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you admitted it?” exclaimed Jack in a
subdued voice. “She’ll tell every German in forty
miles.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, she won’t,” declared Frank. “She was telling
the truth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of all the credulous——” he began.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here. I tell you she was telling the truth,”
declared Frank angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Jack laughed and Frank was about to
make another angry remark when Lord Hastings
interfered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps Frank is right,” he said quietly. “At
all events, it is nothing for you two to fight about.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’re not fighting, sir,” said Jack. “But the
idea——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The idea nothing!” Frank broke in. “I guess
I know what I am talking about. I danced with
her, didn’t I? You didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ha! ha!” said Jack. “You see, sir, he brags
about it. She’s fooled him, all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you believe it, sir,” declared Frank. “I
tell you, sir, the girl was telling me the truth. Why,
sir, you have only to look at her——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now we have it, sir,” exclaimed Jack. “That’s
it. You have only to look at her. Ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you——” Frank began angrily again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack made his chum a bow across the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are right,” he said with a superior air that
only angered Frank the more. “She told you the
truth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Enough of this,” interposed Lord Hastings.
“No matter whether she told the truth or not, we
are in danger. If she didn’t tell the truth we are
likely to be set upon at any moment and if she
did the German officer probably will make trouble.
The best thing we can do is get out of here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He signaled the waiter and paid the check.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come,” he said and got to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>The waiter brought their hats and cloaks and
Lord Hastings moved toward the door. Jack followed
him and Frank came last.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the way to the door it was necessary to pass
the table at which the German officer and his companions
were seated. Lord Hastings walked by
without a glance, as did Jack. Frank would have
followed, but the German suddenly jumped to his
feet and confronted him with an imprecation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stand aside,” said Frank quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The German made no move to comply. At first
Frank thought of pushing the man away; then
changed his mind, for he realized that such an act
would draw all eyes to them. The best plan was
to get by quietly if possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is my belief that you are a spy,” declared the
German.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes?” said Frank inquiringly. “Well, sir,
every man has a right to his own opinion; you as
well as another.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Smart, aren’t you?” sneered the German. He
raised his hand suddenly and, before Frank could
realize his intention, slapped the lad smartly across
the face.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank took a step forward and his hands
clenched. His face turned red and he was about
to return the blow. A second time his better judgment
prevailed and he stepped back, remarking
quietly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shall answer for that, Lieutenant Holzen!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What! you know my name?” exclaimed the
German. “So I shall answer, eh? Yes, so I shall,
at any time and place that suits your convenience.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am no duelist,” said Frank quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; you are a coward,” was the retort.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Frank’s face turned red and his hands
clenched; but he restrained himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For that you shall answer also,” he said. “Now,
stand aside. I would pass.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not much!” said Lieutenant Holzen. “First
you must tell me the time and place of meeting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here, I’m getting tired of this foolishness,”
said Frank. “Get out of my way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean by speaking like that to
me?” demanded the German angrily. “You shall
pass when I allow you to pass, not before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you don’t get out of my way immediately,
I shall have to throw you out,” said Frank very
quietly, which was a sure sign that his anger was
reaching the bursting point.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So?” said the German with a laugh. “Now,
I say——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve said enough,” cried Frank suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He struck out suddenly with his right fist. The
blow went true. Struck upon the point of the jaw,
the German reeled back. Frank straightened him
up again with a left-handed hook to the stomach
and then sent his right fist to the jaw a second time.
The German officer sprawled across the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before any of the others could interfere Frank
dashed toward the door where Lord Hastings and
Jack stood, having watched developments with the
assurance that Frank could take care of himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>All dashed out together.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This way!” cried Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The others followed close on his heels.</p>

<p class='c004'>Behind, as they darted round a corner, they could
hear the hue and cry of the pursuers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to do some sprinting,” declared
Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>For perhaps fifteen minutes they ran, turning
corner after corner, and at last, when Lord Hastings
felt they were safe from pursuit, he drew up
for a much needed breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t tell whether they’ll follow us or not,” he
said. “If they take any stock in the officer’s story
that we are spies, they will. If they think it is just
a private quarrel, the chances are they won’t.
However, we can do no particular good here. We’ll
have to go back and see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anything you say, sir,” agreed Frank. “I suppose
I shouldn’t have hit that fellow, but he
wouldn’t let me by.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t worry about that. You did exactly
right,” declared Lord Hastings. “Come on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He led the way in the direction from which they
had come.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />MARIE DULCÉ.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Things seemed to have quieted down when the
three found themselves again before the café. Apparently
there had been but a faint-hearted pursuit.
All breathed easier.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They can’t have believed very much in that spy
story,” remarked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would seem that way,” agreed Lord Hastings.
“Evidently they took your friend’s words as
the ravings of a man intoxicated.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A good thing, too, sir,” said Jack. “None of
them will molest us, unless it is the doughty lieutenant
himself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We don’t need to worry about him, I guess,”
said Lord Hastings. “Now we must get busy. I
wonder——” as a sudden thought struck him, “if
your friend,” he turned to Frank, “the young lady,
I mean, couldn’t give us, or get for us, the information
we desire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess she could, sir,” replied Frank, “if we
could find her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She probably is still in the café,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And so probably is Lieutenant Holzen,” replied
Frank dryly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“True,” said Lord Hastings. “We can’t afford
to risk another encounter. Guess we’ll have to hunt
up the place she lives. All we have to do is ask
where Mademoiselle—by the way, Frank, what is
her name?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, sir. She didn’t tell me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?” exclaimed Lord Hastings in surprise.
“You are a nice gallant, you are. So you failed to
find out her name, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir. She was just going to tell me when
the music stopped.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe she wasn’t so anxious to tell you,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now look here,” said Frank, “don’t let’s start
that again. If it touches you on a sore spot, I’ll
drop the subject.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, all right,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, the matter should not be so difficult,
anyhow,” declared Lord Hastings. “We’ll ask someone
the name of the young lady who sings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly simple, sir,” agreed Jack. “Whom
shall we ask?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first person we see,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings led the way down the street. An
officer approached. Lord Hastings accosted him in
German.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have recently been ordered to Heligoland,” he
said. “A moment ago I was in yonder café,” pointing,
“and the young singer in there bears such a
striking resemblance to the daughter of a friend of
mine that I should like to know if she is the same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the name of the young lady to whom you
refer?” questioned the German.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Henrietta! Henrietta Blucher!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The German laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you are mistaken,” he said pleasantly.
“The young lady who sings in yonder café is Marie
Dulcé and she is a French girl.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had not taken her to be French,” returned
Lord Hastings. “Can you tell me where she lives?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, certainly,” was the reply, and the German
named an address and gave the necessary directions
for getting there. “I don’t imagine,” he
added, “you will find her home much before 12
o’clock, the café does not close until eleven.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings thanked the man and the latter
took himself off.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we have that much to go on, anyhow,”
said Lord Hastings. “Now the best thing for us
to do is to go to Mlle. Dulcé’s home and await her
arrival.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And maybe they won’t let us in,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to chance that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>An hour later they sought the address given and
mounted the steps. Lord Hastings rang the bell.
A pleasant-appearing woman of middle age answered
their summons. At a glance Lord Hastings
knew she was French and he addressed her in that
language.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Could it be that you are Madame Dulcé?” he
inquired courteously.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman smiled as she answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We,” said Lord Hastings, indicating Frank and
Jack as well as himself, “would have a few words
with your daughter Marie when she returns home.
We have sought her here rather than at the café
for several reasons.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A look of deep anxiety spread itself over
Madame Dulcé’s face and she asked excitedly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What has she done, sir? Surely she will not
be arrested? You do not take her for a spy?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You need have no fear,” returned Lord Hastings
reassuringly. “We mean no harm. May we
come in and wait?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Madame Dulcé led the way into a small, though
cozy parlor and took their hats and coats.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Marie will be here soon after twelve,” she said.
“She always comes straight home, for she knows I
worry about her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How does it happen that she sings in the café?”
asked Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because we are so poor,” was the reply. “Her
salary there enables us to keep the wolf away
from the door. Frau Heffler, who also sings, was
the one who so kindly gave her the opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see,” said Lord Hastings, and became silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>The time passed slowly; but it passed. Frank
waited eagerly, for he was anxious to see the girl
again. Jack noticed the look on his chum’s face
and remarked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now just be patient. Marie will soon be here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s not as bad as that, I assure you,” he returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>Came the sound of light footsteps without. A
key turned in the front door and the footsteps came
toward the parlor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have company, mother?” asked the girl’s
voice as she tripped forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some gentlemen to see you, Marie,” was the
reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the doorway the girl stood spellbound for a
brief instant, as she made out the faces of the
callers. At first she did not recognize Lord Hastings
and Jack, but she knew Frank instantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lieutenant Chadwick!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>She came forward with outstretched hand and
again Frank bent low over it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But tell me,” she said. “How were you able to
find my home? And what is it you want of me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I found your home by asking,” returned Frank.
“As for what we want, I would first present my
commander and brother officer to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Introductions followed all around and then the
girl repeated her question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would rather,” said Lord Hastings, giving
Marie a sharp look, “if we could speak with you
alone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But my mother——” protested the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know,” continued Lord Hastings, “but she
need have no fear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Madame Dulcé arose and smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall leave you,” she said. “When you have
finished your talk, will you call me, Marie?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl nodded and Madame Dulcé left the
room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, gentlemen,” said Marie, turning to the
others.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As commander of this party,” said Lord Hastings
with a smile, “I guess it is up to me, as the
Americans say, to do the talking.” He gazed at
the girl earnestly. “You know something of us
already,” he added, “so there is no harm in putting
ourselves further in your power.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You need have no fear that I shall betray you,”
said the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had no such thought,” responded Lord Hastings
courteously. “Well, then the situation is
this,” and he told her why they had come to Heligoland.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what is it you want of me?” said the girl,
when he had concluded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Recalling what you told Mr. Chadwick you
would do for France,” said Lord Hastings quietly,
“I am here to put you to the test.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl sprang to her feet and her eyes flashed
for a brief instant. Then she sat down again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Try me,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings nodded his satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then,” said he, “can you tell me something of
the fortifications of Heligoland? Can you tell me
its weak spots and its strong? Can you tell me
how many men there are here—how many battleships?
In short, can you tell me anything that will
be of value to the Allies?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can,” was the quiet reply. “Ever since the
war broke out I have been learning things—and
trying to learn more—and I have stored them up in
my memory for just this chance. It has been my
ambition to serve France and it makes me happy
to think I can do so at last.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” said Lord Hastings. “Then perhaps
the best way will be for you to answer my questions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>Bien</i>, Lord Hastings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“First, then, from what you have learned, where
is the weakest spot in the fortifications—the spot
that would be most susceptible to attack?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can answer that quickly,” was the reply.
“There is none.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The number of ships in the harbor?” was Lord
Hastings’ next question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At the moment, seventy-two, cruisers, dreadnoughts
and torpedo boats. The others are in the
Kiel Canal, or in the Baltic.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the number of men now stationed here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t answer that exactly, but the number is
comparatively small. I can find out in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll pass that for the moment, then. Is there
a submarine base here, or do the underwater boats
operate from Kiel?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is a submarine base here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus Lord Hastings questioned the girl at
length and she answered quietly and comprehensively.
The conversation continued for more than
an hour. Lord Hastings, Jack and Frank storing
what the girl told them in their memories for future
use.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now,” said Lord Hastings, “for the final
question.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Marie Dulcé smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m ready,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is there any way in which you can procure for
me a map of the fortress itself, including all its
details?”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a brief moment the girl was silent. Then
she sprang to her feet, her eyes once again flashing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can and I will!” she cried determinedly. “You
shall have the paper to-morrow night before eight
o’clock.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />THAT NIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The conversation having come to this point,
Lord Hastings considered further words useless.
He was deeply impressed by the bearing of the
young French girl and he had no doubt that she
would do what she said—or, at least, that it would
not be her fault if she failed; nor, for that matter,
had Frank or Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Lord Hastings after a short silence,
“that settles that, then. I don’t suppose you will
tell me your plan?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl shook her head and smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s hardly necessary,” she replied. “Now, if
you wish, I shall have mother make a place here for
you for the night. I don’t suppose you have any
other place to go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings shook his head negatively, and
half an hour later the three found themselves in
a cozy little room on the second floor, in which
there were two beds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may sleep securely here,” was Madame
Dulcé’s parting words.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither Jack, Frank, nor the commander wasted
much time getting into bed, for they were all tired
out and a few moments later they were asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>All were astir early in the Dulcé home the following
morning, in spite of the lateness of the hour
at which they had retired.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose you will be on your mission this morning?”
asked Lord Hastings of Marie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” replied the girl with a smile. “To-night
will be time enough. I shall spend the day here
entertaining you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings made a gallant response, but he
did not press the girl for the method she intended
to pursue.</p>

<p class='c004'>The day passed pleasantly and swiftly. Night
came only too soon, thought Frank, who was beginning
to admire the young French girl immensely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dusk fell soon after five o’clock and Marie made
ready to go. Heavily cloaked and muffled, she
turned in the door as she was about to leave.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you will venture to the café again to-night,”
she said, “I shall have the papers for you. There
is no other place where I can give them to you, so
you will have to risk another visit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We shall be there,” said Frank. “I guess we
can avoid Lieutenant Holzen some way, if he
should be there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is always there,” replied Marie and a moment
later she was gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess we had better wait a while,” said Lord
Hastings. “Nothing was ever gained by being in
a rush.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Accordingly it was an hour later—almost half-past
six o’clock—when the three came again to the
little café.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings entered jauntily, not the slightest
nervousness in his manner, though his right hand
in the pocket of his great coat rested upon the butt
of his revolver. Frank and Jack, close behind,
also had a hand thrust into their pockets and there
was no need to mention what lay within the palm of
each.</p>

<p class='c004'>A waiter approached and conducted them to a
table at the far end of the room, but one removed
from the one they had had the night before. Lord
Hastings gave the order and then, for the first time,
glanced around.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no sign of Lieutenant Holzen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Across the room Marie was preparing to sing
and a hush fell over the diners,—which continued
until she had finished. Following came a roar of
approval. It was while she was responding to an
encore that Lieutenant Holzen entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank was the first to see him and gave a start.
He spoke to Lord Hastings in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keep your nerve, now,” was his commander’s
quiet response. “If he comes over here, let me deal
with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Marie had resumed her seat. Lieutenant
Holzen, after glancing toward her, swept the room
with his eyes. As he perceived Lord Hastings and
his two officers, he clenched his hands and took a
step forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment Frank could see that he was
plainly undecided just what to do; then the German
hastily approached.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank gripped the table with both hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before the three, Lieutenant Holzen paused. His
eyes rested upon Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Last night,” he said, “when I was somewhat
the worse for wear, you struck me. I demand
either an apology or the satisfaction due from one
gentleman to another.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings answered for Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If my friend here has insulted you,” he said
quietly, “it is but right that you should demand an
accounting. We shall be here all evening. If you
will send a friend to me, we shall arrange the details.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The German bowed and Lord Hastings, Frank
and Jack did likewise. Then turning on his heel,
Lieutenant Holzen walked away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank kept an eye on him and saw that the young
German spent most of his time gazing at Marie.
Looking in her direction, he was surprised to see
the girl return the young officer’s smile. She
nodded to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank mentioned the matter to Lord Hastings,
and added:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Jack. “So you are getting
jealous, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank flushed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know better than that,” he replied sharply.
“I just don’t like it; that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly, in response to a smile from Marie,
Lieutenant Holzen arose and approached her. The
music was about to commence and Frank realized
what was going to happen. For some reason he
could not explain to himself he felt decidedly uncomfortable
and shifted uneasily in his seat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack noticed this and was about to make a remark
greatly to his chum’s discomfort, when Lord
Hastings stayed him with a gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quiet now,” he said, “and if I am not mistaken
and you look sharp, you may see something interesting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The music struck up at this juncture and Marie
and Lieutenant Holzen glided smoothly across the
floor. Lord Hastings, Jack and Frank followed
them with their eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last the music stopped. The young German
escorted Marie back to her place and returned to
his own table.</p>

<p class='c004'>Time passed swiftly now for the three British
officers. Again Marie danced with the young German
officer, and yet a third time. But when he came
for his fourth dance, she shook her head and inclined
it toward Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter had been watching her eagerly and
this time he did not hesitate. Getting quickly to
his feet he strode across the room and offered the
girl his arm. A moment later the music struck
up again and the two glided across the floor much
to the discomfiture of the young German, who
stood gnawing his mustache and fingering his sword
belt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Frank felt the girl’s hand slide into his
inside breast pocket and heard the faint crumple of
paper. He was about to speak, but Marie silenced
him with a warning: “Sh-h-h.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Half a moment later she whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The papers you are after are in your pocket. I
took them from Lieutenant Holzen as we danced.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank made no reply, but he pressed slightly the
fingers that rested so lightly in his own. It was a
signal and the girl understood.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now go immediately,” she whispered, as the
music came to a stop and Frank led her back to her
place.</p>

<p class='c004'>But first Frank must needs lean over her hand
again to say good-bye.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall see you again, some time,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Marie smiled, but said nothing. Frank returned
to the others.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have the papers,” he said quietly to Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good! I had surmised as much,” was his commander’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She said that we had better go immediately,”
said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can’t do that,” said Lord Hastings. “You
may remember we have an appointment with a
friend of Lieutenant Holzen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was half an hour later that this friend approached
them. Lord Hastings rose to greet him,
as did Jack. Frank remained seated.</p>

<p class='c004'>The newcomer introduced himself and Lord
Hastings gave a fictitious name, also introducing
Jack and Frank in the same manner. Then they
went into details of the duel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As the challenged party,” said Lord Hastings,
thinking to keep up appearances, “we have the
choice of weapons.” The German bowed. “Then,”
said Lord Hastings, “we name revolvers at twenty
paces.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. And the time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings seemed to consider for a moment.
At last he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the morning at six o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the place?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That shall rest with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man designated a spot and Lord Hastings
announced that it would be satisfactory. The German
bowed and took his departure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing like keeping up appearances, sir,” said
Jack with a smile. “To have heard you talk, no
one would have expected that you knew the duel
was not coming off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I flatter myself it wasn’t done so badly,” returned
Lord Hastings modestly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And how soon shall we go, sir?” asked Frank.
Lord Hastings produced his watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eight o’clock,” he said, putting the timepiece
back in his pocket. “We haven’t much time, and
yet we have considerable. I believe we had as well
stay here until half-past. We can make it in that
time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As you will, sir,” returned Frank, and settled
back in his chair to enjoy the music.</p>

<p class='c004'>But his enjoyment of the music was to be short-lived.
Trouble came suddenly and unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank, chancing to glance toward Lieutenant
Holzen, saw that worthy put his hand to his breast
pocket. Immediately his face turned red and he
sprang to his feet. Hurriedly he thrust his hands
into all his pockets. Then his face turned from red
to white.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank nudged Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Holzen has discovered his loss, sir,” he said
quietly. “Had we better move?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings sat still.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Too bad,” he said calmly. “I am afraid this
means trouble. We’ll probably have to fight and
run. Guns ready, boys.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads dropped both hands to the holsters that
hung on either side of their belts. They were
ready.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll let him start the trouble,” said Lord Hastings
quietly. “Then we’ll make a break for the
door.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Holzen was not long starting the
trouble. He sprang to his feet with a shout.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are traitors and spies in this room!” he
shouted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />FLIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Frank made a move to rise. Lord Hastings
stayed him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait!” was all he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Immediately following Lieutenant Holzen’s
words, there was a terrible commotion in the café.
Officers jumped quickly to their feet. Several
rushed to Lieutenant Holzen, who still stood there
gesticulating wildly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Traitors! Spies!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Be calm,” said one of the officers. “Tell me
what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My papers!” shouted the young German. “My
papers! The charts of the fortress! They are
gone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible!” cried one of the others. “You
must be mistaken. Look through your pockets
again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I looked through them!” was the shouted response.
“See here! and here!” and he turned them
all wrong side out.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps you left them in your rooms,” said another
officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I brought them with me. I had them when
I sat down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But no one has come near you,” said one of his
companions. “But wait a moment. You danced
with Mlle. Dulcé. Could she have taken them? You
danced with her several times; yet, on previous
nights, I have noticed that she avoided you. It
must be she.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes! It must be she!” cried Lieutenant Holzen.
“Arrest her!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Half-a-dozen men moved down the room toward
where Marie Dulcé stood smiling. It was at that
moment that Lord Hastings gave the signal to rise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Up and run for the door!” he cried. “Shoot the
first man who draws a gun!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He suited the action to the word, and the two
lads were right behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before Lord Hastings loomed up the figure of a
German colonel. The commander of the D-17 fired
point-blank and the man fell to the floor. Lord
Hastings dashed on.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Marie took a hand in things herself. As
one of the Germans would have seized her, she
stepped quickly backward and reached upward on
the wall. There her hand found what she knew it
would find—an electric switch. Quickly she threw
it and the room was plunged into utter darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Eluding the grasp of the man who reached for
her in the darkness, Marie stepped quickly forward.
Keeping close to the wall, she made her way toward
the front door. On all sides men shouted and
women screamed, but the girl went on calmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Occasional revolver flashes lighted up the darkness,
but only momentarily.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings, reaching the door, found it barred
by two men. Before he could bring his revolver to
bear, an outstretched arm sent it spinning from his
hand. Lord Hastings growled and struck out with
his fist. An arm encircled his neck and held him
powerless. At the same time a voice called out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got one of them!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack, who was immediately behind his commander,
although he could not see what was going on,
realized from the German’s words what was up,
and called out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here,” came the reply. “A man has me around
the neck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack’s lips shut grimly, and, leaving Frank to
guard their rear, he stepped quickly forward and
laid his hand on a man’s arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have I hold of you, or the enemy, sir?” he
asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must be the German,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack ran his hand up the arm until he felt a face.
Then he drew back his left arm and his fist crashed
forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” said Lord Hastings. “You’ve
dropped him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The second man who had blocked the doorway
now closed in, but Jack disposed of him quickly.
Shots came from behind, and Frank’s voice cried:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Getting too warm, sir. Let’s move.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come on, then,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>He threw his weight against the door, and it
crashed open. A moment later all three were in the
street and running in the direction of the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>A crowd of Germans poured from the café after
them, and the crack of revolvers sounded like a
rapid-fire gun in action.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to hurry!” cried Lord Hastings.
“They’ll have the whole fortress on our heels in a
moment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Directly the water front came into view.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here we are!” cried Lord Hastings. “Quick,
now!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He made directly toward the D-17’s motorboat,
which he could see was where he had left it, but at
that moment a figure blocked the way. It was a
German sentinel, and his rifle was pointed squarely
at Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Halt!” he said sternly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s all the row back there?” demanded the
sentry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings would have replied, but Jack did
not give him time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stepping suddenly from behind Lord Hastings,
he dived at the German’s legs. He had gauged the
distance accurately, and the two went to the ground
violently. The sentry’s gun was discharged, but
the bullet whistled harmlessly over Lord Hastings’s
head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No time to fool with him, Jack!” cried Lord
Hastings. “Here come the others. Hurry!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack raised his opponent’s head in his two hands,
then bumped it against the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There,” he said, rising, “that’ll keep him for a
while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He hurried after the others, who had jumped into
the boat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cut the line there—quick!” commanded Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank obeyed just as Jack tumbled aboard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, sir. All here,” said the latter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” said Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boat moved off, slowly at first, then faster
and faster.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the time the German pursuers had reached the
water’s edge, the boat was beyond revolver shot,
though still within range of rifles.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Down!” cried Lord Hastings, as a bullet whistled
overhead.</p>

<p class='c004'>The others obeyed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll be after us, sir!” shouted Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll have to hurry if they want to catch us,”
declared Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say! What time is it?” asked Frank suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?” demanded his chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” repeated Frank, “because if we get out
here before nine o’clock we might just as well stay
ashore. Price will not come to the surface until
nine sharp.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By the flare of a match he struck, Jack gazed at
his watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No need to worry there, then,” he said. “It’s
three minutes to nine right now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty lucky,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rather,” commented Lord Hastings dryly.
“Look back and see if they are following us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir, twenty of them,” replied Frank, after
a glance over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we’ll have time, unless they are armed
with cannon,” said Lord Hastings. “All we need
is to get aboard the D-17. Rifle shots won’t hurt
us then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rifle bullets continued to fly over and about the
motorboat, one occasionally striking home. But
none of the occupants was touched.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We must be about the place,” said Frank suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“About a minute more,” responded Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The minute up, Lord Hastings shut off the engine.
They gazed about.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If Price doesn’t come up pretty quick, we’ll have
to run for it,” said the commander quietly. “It’s
time now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll be up unless something has gone wrong,”
said Jack positively.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unless he’s gone to sleep,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I wish he’d hurry,” said Jack. “We can’t
remain here many minutes longer. They are getting
too close.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So they are,” agreed Lord Hastings. “We’ll
wait thirty seconds, then, if there is not some sign
of the D-17, we’ll move. We’ll make a fight for it,
at any rate.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The seconds ticked off slowly; and then, just as
Lord Hastings was ready to open the engine, the
waters of the sea parted and the neat outline of the
D-17 appeared upon the surface.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later the conning tower opened and
Price stepped on deck. The submarine was perhaps
fifty yards away, and Lord Hastings ran the
motorboat toward it at full speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here we are, Price!” he called.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, but pursued. Below with you, and be
ready to submerge the minute we are below.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Price disappeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later the motorboat scraped alongside
the submarine, and the three clambered over the
side as fast as they could amid a veritable rain of
bullets, none of which, however, found its mark.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Down with you, quick!” shouted Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack dashed for the companionway at
top speed, Lord Hastings right behind them. Down
the ladder they went with a rush, and the conning
tower was hermetically closed behind them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Submerge to ten fathoms, and quickly, Mr. Templeton!”
said Lord Hastings quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack repeated the command, slowly the tanks began
to fill, and the D-17 to submerge, the while the
occupants of the motorboats without peppered the
side of the vessel with rifle and revolver bullets.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall I launch a torpedo at them, sir?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not much use,” he said. “You might hit one,
and you might not. It’s not worth a chance. But
we haven’t any time to lose now. They know we’re
here, and the quicker we get out the better. They’ll
have every German submarine in these waters on the
hunt for us. Fortunately, we have the heels of
any of them, and we can still see while submerged.
They don’t know that; so, for the moment, the advantage
is on our side.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, sir,” protested Jack, “how about the other
part of our plans here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?” demanded Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Warship, or two, sir,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“True,” said Lord Hastings. “I had forgotten.
Shape your course due north for two miles, Mr.
Templeton; then come to the surface.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to Frank and spoke again:</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll leave our card, at any rate,” he said
quietly. “You may prepare for action, Mr. Chadwick!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />THE ATTACK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>An instant later every man aboard the D-17 was
on the alert. Lord Hastings stood at the periscope,
which, immediately the submarine had reached the
desired place, would make visible to him the great
German battleships upon the surface of the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack stood to their posts, ready and
eager for the word that would send one of the steel
engines of destruction speeding into the hull of the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was not a man aboard who did not realize
that they were indeed in a ticklish situation; for, besides
the danger that always attended such an
undertaking, there was the additional danger now of encountering
one or more of the German under-water
boats.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nor was there a chance of a surprise attack.
Lord Hastings was well aware that the presence of
a hostile submarine had been flashed to every German
battleship in the harbor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Above, the sea was being swept with powerful
searchlights, while below the under-sea craft of
the Germans were dashing hither and thither in a
vain endeavor to find some trace of the enemy who
had so brazenly dared to enter what the Germans
believed an impenetrable base.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings now turned to Jack with a command:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may come to the surface, Mr. Templeton.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack repeated the command with alacrity; and
when the D-17 had risen so that her periscope barely
protruded above the top of the water, she was kept
stationary.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you see, sir?” asked Frank of Lord
Hastings, who now peered intently into the periscope.</p>

<p class='c004'>“German battleship half a mile to port and another
half a mile astern,” was the reply. “The
others are too far away for us, although they might
reach us with a shell if their lights should happen to
pick us up. We’ll make for the fellow to port and
trust to luck that we get near enough without being
spotted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He gave the necessary directions to Frank, who
had taken the wheel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fortune was with the D-17 this night, for the
submarine approached within less than a hundred
and fifty yards of the German battleship without
being perceived. There, at a command from Lord
Hastings, she became stationary.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. 1 torpedo!” commanded Lord Hastings
suddenly, and gave the range.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack touched a little button, and the signal board
flashed red.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Attention!” was the next command that glowed
in letters of fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The British sailor at No. 1 torpedo stood ready
to release his instrument of destruction.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a slight pause. Then:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fire!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Followed a slight metallic click as the engine of
death sped on its way over the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Contrary to the expectations of the others, Lord
Hastings did not immediately give the command to
submerge. Instead, he stood perfectly motionless,
peering into the periscope. There was silence aboard
the D-17, broken finally by Frank, who could stand
the suspense no longer:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did we hit her, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>For answer, Lord Hastings stepped aside and
motioned the lad to his place at the periscope. Frank,
turning the wheel over to a sailor, sprang forward
quickly. And here is what he saw:</p>

<p class='c004'>A short distance to port, a huge German battleship
was slowly sinking by the head. Fully half
a hundred great searchlights—the eyes of the many
other German ships of war—played upon the sinking
vessel now, lighting her up like day. Movements
aboard the sinking vessel were plainly visible to
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Men rushed hither and thither in the greatest confusion,
and while Frank could hear no sounds there
below the water, there was every indication of
shouts and cries of panic and of fright.</p>

<p class='c004'>An officer rushed aft and sought to maintain
some semblance of order among the members of the
crew who were seeking to get a small boat over the
side at that end of the ship. A German sailor struck
him down with a blow of his fist and returned to
his place at the boat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Men struggled frantically. The German officer
picked himself up and drew a revolver; then advanced
again upon the sailors. One sprang forward,
but fell sprawling upon the deck. No sound
came to Frank, but he knew that the German officer
had fired.</p>

<p class='c004'>One, two, three others of the struggling sailors
now fell before the revolver of the infuriated German
officer; the others gave back. Frank saw the
man gesticulating angrily; and the sailors fell to
getting the boat over in a more orderly manner, apparently
more afraid of the officer who confronted
them with leveled revolver than they were of the
imminent danger of the ship going to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Forward, aboard the German battleship also were
signs of confusion. There, too, officers had their
hands full in attempting to maintain discipline.
Several times one of their number fired into the
faces of the crowd of sailors.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the great German ship staggered visibly
and a dull roar carried to the ears of those
aboard the D-17.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Explosion,” Frank explained to those behind
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fire aboard must have reached her magazine,”
said Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>And indeed such was the case. When the great
ship staggered there was a terrible roar, louder than
the loudest peal of thunder. Ensued a greater
panic than before aboard the German vessel.</p>

<p class='c004'>No longer did men fight for the boats. No longer
did they heed the cries of their officers to stick to
the ship and die like true German sailors. Instead,
they rushed for the rails and threw themselves into
the sea in scores. Several times officers rushed in
between them, but they were hurled aside. It was
every man for himself now, and finally the officers
gave up the attempt to check the panic.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the sailors continued to leap into the sea, the
officers congregated on the bridge, gathering about
a tall figure, apparently the German commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>And at length, besides these officers, there was
not a man to be seen aboard the battleship. Then
the commander raised his hand in a commanding
gesture. A dozen of the score of officers left him
and threw themselves into the sea after the sailors.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another command from the German captain and
others left his side, though plainly more reluctantly.
This continued until, besides the commander, there
were but two men left.</p>

<p class='c004'>“His first officers, I suppose,” Frank muttered to
himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the German commander gesticulated angrily.
The others argued back. The commander
stamped his foot. One of the officers laid a hand
on his arm. The commander shook it off.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They want him to go along,” said Frank, who
had already explained the situation to Lord Hastings
and the others within hearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are wasting time,” said Lord Hastings.
“I know these German naval commanders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank peered across the water again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now both of the officers had hold of the commander
and were seeking to drag him toward the
side of the ship. Apparently they held him firmly,
for Frank could see that he was trying hard to
shake off their hands. But he was held too securely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even from where he stood, Frank could see the
commander shrug his shoulders. Immediately the
other officers released their hold. All moved toward
the side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re wrong this time, sir,” said Frank to Lord
Hastings. “The commander is going.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe it,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, he is, sir. He——”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank broke off suddenly, for there were new
developments aboard the sinking battleship.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the very side of the ship the commander hung
back. The other officers protested. The captain
was adamant. Again the others sought to seize
him by the arms. But the commander had anticipated
this action, and he leaped lightly backward,
at the same time presenting a brace of revolvers.
The others halted in their tracks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the commander motioned the others over
the side, gesticulating with his weapons. The others
shook their heads. The commander raised both
revolvers and pointed each at one of his officers.
Still they shook their heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove!” said Frank. “There are three of
them going to stick now!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He shouldn’t allow that,” said Lord Hastings.
“He is still the commander of the vessel. He has
the privilege of staying if he chooses, but he should
order the others off the ship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He has, sir, but they refuse to go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then he should insist.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s even threatened them, sir. But they won’t
go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it’s their funeral,” said Lord Hastings
briefly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The German commander had now given up his
attempt to force the others to leave the ship; and
the three men stood quietly upon the bridge, awaiting
the end.</p>

<p class='c004'>And it came suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The German battleship suddenly seemed to leap
clear of the water—the result of a second explosion,
the sound of which was again barely audible to
those aboard the D-17—and came down in twain.
The afterpart of the vessel disappeared beneath the
water almost immediately, but in some unaccountable
manner, the portion forward still floated. It
was upon this that the three officers stood.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each man stood erect, his face tilted a trifle toward
the sky. The huge flashlights from the other
vessels in the harbor lighted them up plainly, and
Frank could see that each of the three was smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly now what was left of the battleship sank,
the center of a broad circle of brilliancy. Down,
down. Now the water had reached almost to the
bridge. Now the officers stood in water up to their
knees. Then the wreck dived.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank relinquished his place at the periscope to
Lord Hastings, remarking:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, she’s gone; and three brave men with
her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no reply to this remark.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the water close to the D-17 splashed
violently. Lord Hastings looked about sharply.
Again the water was kicked up, this time on the
starboard how.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ve spotted us,” said the commander of the
D-17. “Every ship in the fleet is bearing down on
us. Submerge to five fathoms, Mr. Templeton.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack repeated the command and the D-17 dived.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now what, sir?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s too risky to tackle any more of them,” was
the reply. “We’ll make for the Kiel Canal.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Kiel Canal?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; we are headed for the Baltic.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But——” began Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will do well to remember,” said Lord Hastings,
“that sometimes I keep my plans to myself.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />IN THE BALTIC.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Great Scott! What was that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Frank who spoke. He picked himself up
from where he had been thrown by a violent shock
and rubbed his head ruefully, glancing at Lord
Hastings quietly the while.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings also had been hurled against the
side of his cabin, as had Jack, who also was now
regaining his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings’ reply was brief, and it was not
an answer to Frank’s question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Submerge quickly, Mr. Templeton!” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack gave the command.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings stepped to the tube that connected
with the engine room. A voice came back to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello?” it said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Any damage to the engines, Jarvis?” asked Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“None, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anybody hurt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one but me. Head bruised a bit, sir, by
being thrown against the boiler. Nothing serious,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings stepped from the tube.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” he said to Frank, “I’ll answer your question.
While I can’t say for sure, my guess would
be that, in rising, we came up under an ice floe or
an iceberg. That would account for the shock.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove!” Jack ejaculated. “I hadn’t thought
of such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nor had I,” said Lord Hastings, “but I should
have thought of it. At this time of year it is no
uncommon thing for large icebergs to be floating
about in the Baltic. I am sure that is what is
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then what shall we do, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we’ll have to run on a ways. When we are
from beneath the berg, we shall try again to get to
the surface.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He gave the signal for ten knots ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>The D-17 had passed through the Kiel Canal
without difficulty, in spite of the German belief that
such a feat was impossible; and this German belief
persisted in spite of the fact that Lord Hastings and
his two young officers had performed such a feat
once before—and the Germans were aware of it.
Apparently, however, the enemy was confident a
second attempt would never be made.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a long time ago now that the perilous trip
had been made, but all three remembered it well.
They had spoken of it often as the submarine made
its way along slowly, a keen lookout being kept
forward for mines or other obstructions.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later Lord Hastings decided that
the D-17 must have passed from under the iceberg,
or whatever it was that had barred the vessel’s attempt
to come to the surface.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll try it again, now,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class='c004'>In response to his commands the pumps began to
work very slowly, for Lord Hastings had no mind
to crash into an obstruction with the same force as
before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The vessel might stand it and it might not,” he
explained as his reason for his caution. “There is
no need testing the strength of our shell unless absolutely
necessary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you think she could force her way through,
sir?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It all depends,” was his commander’s rejoinder.
“It depends upon the thickness of the ice above.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The D-17 rose gradually; then, with a slight grating
sound, she paused suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bumped it again,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must be quite an iceberg,” was Jack’s comment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unless the sea is frozen over solidly for a considerable
distance,” supplemented Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that could hardly be,” protested Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, yes, it could. It has happened more than
once; and for that reason it may possibly happen—or
have happened—again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then what is our next move, sir?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll proceed under water a ways and then try
again. If we don’t come up next time, we’ll try and
force our way to the surface. We’ve got to get up
for a look around, and the sooner the better. The
ice is likely to grow thicker with each succeeding
minute.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the D-17 proceeded under water for perhaps
half an hour and then Lord Hastings announced
his intention of trying to rise.</p>

<p class='c004'>The result this time was the same. After ascending
several fathoms, the submarine encountered ice
and stopped.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, there is no help for it,” said Lord Hastings.
“We’ll have to try and break through. Submerge
to ten fathoms, Mr. Templeton.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack repeated the command and the D-17 dived
deeper. At the proper depth, the vessel’s course was
checked. Then Lord Hastings ordered that the
craft be brought to the surface with as much force
as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>The water was sent from the tanks with a rush
and the D-17 seemed to leap upward. A few moments
later there was a violent shock and all aboard
were thrown from their feet. The submarine had
failed to break through.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Again!” cried Lord Hastings and gave the signal
to submerge.</p>

<p class='c004'>A second attempt met with no better result and
Lord Hastings immediately commanded a third trial.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to get through now or we’ll probably
drown,” he said quietly. “I am afraid we have
strained our seams. We’ll need an overhauling immediately
we put into Petrograd—if we are fortunate
enough to get there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what do you suppose has happened to our
periscope?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, that has been smashed to bits before now,”
said Lord Hastings quietly. “However, we can rig
up another one if it is necessary before we get to
port.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All ready for the next trial, sir,” Jack put in at
this juncture. “We are down five fathoms.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. Let her go,” replied his commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>This time the D-17 rose even more swiftly than
before. Again there was a violent shock, followed
by a crashing sound; and then the submarine floated
clear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hoorah! We’re up, sir,” shouted Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t crow too soon,” was the reply. “We may
be up, but there is no telling yet what condition we
are in. We’ll go on deck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings led the way and the two lads followed
closely behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside a strange sight met their gaze. To the
north, to the south and to the east and west, as far
as the eye could reach, there was nothing but ice.
True, it was broken in places, but it was none the
less ice. The D-17 was hemmed in closely on all
sides.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack expressed the sentiments of the others with a
long whistle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, what do you think of that?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think it’s pretty tough, if you are talking to
me,” was Frank’s reply. “We can’t push through
that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; and we can’t stay here and wait for it to
thaw,” declared his chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then what?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings, who had not spoken up to this moment,
now broke his silence and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never give up the ship, boys. While there’s life,
there’s hope.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And have you a plan of some kind, sir?” asked
Jack eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I have something that might be called a
plan. If you look closely you will see that a hundred
yards ahead there, there is what appears to be a lane—where
the ice is broken. Do you see it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” replied both lads in a single voice.
“But the ice between the D-17 and that spot is solid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So it is. What we shall do is to dive, shape our
course for that particular point and try to come to
the surface there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what good will that do, sir?” demanded
Frank. “The chances are that the ice beyond that
point is just as thick as it is here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll find that out when we get there,” said
Lord Hastings. “Let’s go below.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They did so. The conning tower was immediately
sealed, and the submarine submerged to a depth necessary
to avoid any points of ice that might be likely
to protrude beneath the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings had gauged the distance accurately,
and when he again gave the command to
come to the surface, the D-17 rose gently, pushing
the loosely formed ice to both sides as her nose
appeared from the deep. Lord Hastings and his
two young officers immediately went on deck again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove!” said Frank after a quick glance
around. “The ice doesn’t seem to be so thick dead
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You see,” said Lord Hastings with a smile, “a
little perseverance will go a long ways sometimes.
Now, according to your reasoning awhile back,
there was really no use in trying to reach this spot.
But now that we are here you see still further hope.
Remember that there is always a fighting chance,
no matter how great the odds against you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll remember, sir,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope you will. Now we’ll try our luck at forcing
a passage through the ice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In what way, sir?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings’ next words were explanation
enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Full speed ahead!” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c004'>In response to the command, the D-17 dashed
straight at the ice ahead. Her sharp, steel nose
plowed into it with violence, and the ice, thick
though it was, parted and the D-17 edged through
as swiftly as could be expected.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove! I didn’t think she’d do it, sir,” Jack
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings smiled a bit.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not sure that she can keep it up without
straining something,” he said. “But it is better to
be on the move than lying still. The ice won’t part
for us of its own free will, that’s sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Still the D-17 plowed slowly along; and then,
perhaps half a mile from the starting point, she
stopped.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Back her and try again,” was Lord Hastings’
command.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was done and again the vessel made headway.
This process was repeated time after time;
and some five hours later, those upon deck made
out clear water beyond, though there was a considerable
expanse of ice to penetrate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Undaunted, Lord Hastings continued to force
the D-17 against the apparently impenetrable barrier;
and at last the D-17 broke clear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now for Petrograd at full speed,” he said.
“We’ll have a look over the ship as we go along.
There is no need stopping to do it here. Every
minute may be precious. Take the wheel, Mr. Chadwick,
while I make a tour of inspection.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank did so, and Lord Hastings turned to Jack
with this command:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Full speed ahead, Mr. Templeton!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />ASHORE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In spite of the fact that, upon investigation, Lord
Hastings found the D-17 leaking in several places,
serious trouble in the engine room and other minor
wounds suffered in her battle with the ice, the submarine
made Petrograd safely and under her own
steam.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was broad daylight of the following day when
the vessel sighted land. At the same time a Russian
man-o’-war, sighting the D-17, immediately cleared
for action and gave a signal for the submarine to
heave-to. Lord Hastings obeyed and a launch put
over the side and came toward the D-17. A few
moments later Lord Hastings and a Russian officer
were closeted in the former’s cabin aboard the submarine.
When they emerged, the D-17 proceeded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several hours later found Lord Hastings, Frank
and Jack ashore, the D-17 having been turned over
to the Russian naval authorities for repair. It was
found that it would be necessary to put the craft
in dry dock and this meant that several weeks must
elapse before the submarine could be put in commission
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what are we going to do all that time, I’d
like to know?” said Frank, plainly disappointed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we might look about Petrograd a bit,” said
Jack with a faint smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold on there,” said Lord Hastings. “I intend
keeping an eye on you fellows this time. You may
remember the trouble you had on your last trip here.
Nothing more like that if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid we won’t have much of a time this
trip,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are afraid you won’t, eh?” repeated Lord
Hastings. “Well, I’m in hopes you won’t, and
neither will you if there is anything I can do to prevent
it. To tell the truth, I am half way inclined to
have you both locked up for safe keeping, until the
time comes for us to sail.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, we’ll be good, sir,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will, you may be sure of that,” returned
Lord Hastings. “If you’re not, you may take my
word that I will have something done with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now, sir,” said Jack, “will you not tell us
something of the nature of the reason for this sudden
trip to Russia?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll learn soon enough,” was the reply. “I
don’t suppose you would have any objections to paying
your respects to the Czar?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not the slightest, sir,” said Frank with a smile.
“I remember once when Jack paid his respects in a
manner he did not wish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I remember that, too,” agreed his chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have no doubt that the Czar will be glad to see
you again,” said Lord Hastings. “He will remember
he probably owes his life to you, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack flushed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope you will not remind him of it, sir,” he
replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe that will be necessary,” declared
Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nor was it, as events transpired; and it was in
this audience of the Czar that the boys learned the
reason for their trip to Russia.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar received Lord Hastings and his officers
the moment their names were presented. When
the three entered his presence, he arose quickly and
came forward with extended hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, my lord,” he exclaimed, “I had hardly
expected to see you again so soon.” He turned to
the two lads. “And these,” he added, “are your two
young officers who were with you before. Ah, I
remember. It is to them I owe my life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He extended a hand to each and both lads flushed.
Jack, the subject of a monarch himself, dropped to
one knee; but Frank, who recognized no monarch,
bowed low, and remained on his feet. The Czar signalled
Jack to rise and then turned to Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Am I to consider this just a friendly call, or
have you anything to impart to me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Both, your Majesty,” replied Lord Hastings
gravely. “I may as well come to the point of my
mission at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do,” said the Czar briefly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well. What I have to say is this: In your
service—and in high standing and authority—is a
man who is a traitor—a man who has sold out to
our common foe, the Germans.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So?” said the Czar, apparently no whit surprised.
“His name, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“His name,” said Lord Hastings with a faint
smile, “will surprise you. I fear you will find it
hard to believe; and had I not the proof of the man’s
duplicity, I should not have the courage to mention
the man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Evidently Lord Hastings’ words made an impression
upon the Czar. He stirred uneasily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come, come,” he said. “The man’s name. Out
with it, my Lord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“His name,” said Lord Hastings very gravely,
“is Count Stephan Blowinski!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” roared the Czar, leaping from his seat.
“Count Blowinski! The chief of the Russian secret
police! Impossible, Lord Hastings. I would stake
my life and throne upon his integrity, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you would lose both, sire,” said Lord Hastings
gravely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it cannot be!” protested the Czar of all the
Russias. “Count Blowinski has been, almost, my
right hand. He has served me well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is none the less true that he is a traitor,” replied
Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Realizing that Lord Hastings was in deadly earnest,
the Czar became more calm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must be mistaken, my lord,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would that I were, your Majesty. But I am not.
I have the proof here in my pocket,” and he tapped
his breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then let me have it!” exclaimed the Czar. “Let
me have it, man! I must know the truth of this
matter at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Quietly and without another word Lord Hastings
unbuttoned his coat and from his inside pocket took
a small packet, which he placed in the outstretched
hand of the Czar. Then he sat back and eyed the
Czar keenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar broke the tape that bound the package
with nervous fingers, shook out the papers as nervously
and cast his eyes upon the words they contained.
For long minutes he pored over the
several documents, his brow becoming blacker and
blacker; and at last he raised his head and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are right, my lord. Nothing further than
these papers are needed to convince me of Count
Blowinski’s treachery.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings bowed quietly, and the Czar, again
glancing at the papers, became lost in his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So,” he muttered to himself, “you are a traitor,
eh? You, whom I have treated like a brother and
whom I have showered with honors. You would
betray me to the Germans. Well, you should know
how we deal with traitors.” He turned to Lord
Hastings. “I have to thank you, my lord,” he said.
“I shall deal with this traitor at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sire!” exclaimed Lord Hastings, “if I may be
permitted to say a word.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Speak,” said the Czar briefly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, sire, I would suggest that you do not act
hastily in this matter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And why?” demanded the Russian ruler.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because, sire, the Count Blowinski undoubtedly
has a strong following. He will not be deposed so
easily as you imagine. If you execute him summarily,
there is no telling what may result—revolution,
anarchy—no man can tell. Let the man convict
himself in the eyes of the people—or in his own
eyes and put an end to himself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For the space of several moments the Czar was
silent, considering. When he raised his eyes again,
Lord Hastings knew that his better judgment would
prevail.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are right, my lord,” said the Czar quietly.
“Count Blowinski has indeed a large following,
though it is my own fault that he has. I have enabled
him to obtain it. Why, even now he is in
Moscow attending to details of a campaign I have
planned that, should it be successful, would be one
of the greatest steps toward ending the war that
has been taken.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I have no doubt that he is attending to it—in
his own way,” said Lord Hastings grimly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No doubt whatever,” agreed the Czar with a
faint smile. “But now what’s to be done?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The thing to do,” said Lord Hastings, “is to
catch him in an act of treason; then expose him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Easily said,” returned the Czar. “But how?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I may be able to help with an idea,” said Lord
Hastings, and continued: “Why not set a man to
watch him. Let this man come beneath his eye in
some peculiar manner, say, apparently as a German
spy himself. Have him arrested by the count’s own
men and then let a demand that he see the count,
reach the traitor’s ears. Thinking that there has
been some word sent him, Blowinski will see the
man. Then this man will invent a plausible story,
that he may ingratiate himself with the count. Such
a story should not be hard to concoct. The rest
would be a question of time only. Learning just
when the count planned to take his final step, the
man could communicate with you and when the time
for this step came, you, knowing what he was
about to do, would hold the whip hand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A clever idea,” declared the Czar after some
consideration, “if I could but lay hands upon the
man. He must be one who speaks German like a
native German and one whom the count could never,
by any chance, have seen before. If I could only
find a man equal to such a task!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or men, or boys, sire,” said Frank boldly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar and Lord Hastings both whirled upon
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is that?” demanded the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean, sire,” said Frank, flushing slightly, “that
my chum here and I would be only too glad to undertake
such a mission. I am sure that we come up to
requirements.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible!” declared Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the Czar had been eyeing the two lads keenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not at all,” he said in reply to Lord Hastings’
remark. “Not at all, my lord. If I can satisfy
myself that these young fellows could do the work,
I would ask you for their services.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I am forced to say they could do the work
possibly better than any others,” Lord Hastings
grudgingly admitted. “In fact, I know it. But I
would hate to lose them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you are not going to lose them,” declared the
Czar. “If they are as smart as I think they are,
they will come through with this thing famously.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed we will, sire,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” laughed the Czar. He turned again to
Lord Hastings. “My lord,” he said, “I crave your
permission for the use of these two officers of yours
upon the mission you have suggested.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am loath to part with them, your Majesty,”
Lord Hastings replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But for the cause?” inquired the Czar softly.
“For the cause.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For our cause,” he replied, “I would do much.
I cannot deny you, sire.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />COUNT BLOWINSKI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“You are sure now that you know exactly what
to do?” asked Czar Nicholas of the two lads several
hours later.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly, your Majesty,” said Frank with a
bow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We have our instructions well memorized, sire,”
Jack agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well. Now if you will step into the next
room you will find clothing laid out for you. I have
seen to all arrangements while you were discussing
details with Lord Hastings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you say the papers that are to be found on
us are concealed in the lining of the coats, sir?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I had them prepared hurriedly, but they
will pass muster. They are identical; so, when the
count finds them, he will believe, as I wish him to
believe, that they were sent in duplicate that he
might be sure of getting one if the other was
caught.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And we are not to know the contents, sire?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is not necessary,” was the reply. “You will
shape your course according to events as they transpire.
First, you must get into the good graces of the
count.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll try, sire,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two lads stepped into the next room, where,
as the Czar had said, two suits of clothing were laid
out. The garments caused the lads no little wonder
that they could have been procured so readily. Of
coarse weave, they were, nevertheless, of unmistakable
German pattern, when examined closely. There
was no hint of Russian manufacture about them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dressed and ready, they returned to where the
Czar and Lord Hastings awaited them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All ready, sire,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar nodded. Walking to a little cabinet at
the far end of the room, he returned with two wicked
looking automatics. He extended one to each lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A present from my kingly cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm,”
he said. “May they stand you in good stead.
Now, you are sure that you understand the situation
perfectly?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good, then. Now, I will not tell you how I shall
arrange for you to be picked up by Count Blowinski.
You will know in due season. All you have to do is
to board the night express for Moscow. It is now
dark and the train will not leave for another hour.
You have plenty of time, and money for your tickets
you will find in your pockets. When events have
shaped themselves so that you know there will be no
chance of a slip, you will let me know in some manner.
Trust no agents. I leave the way to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar extended a hand to each lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good luck to you both,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads bowed and then made their way from
the palace, leaving Lord Hastings behind, for it had
been agreed that he should not be seen with them.
They had secured directions to the railroad station
and once outside the palace they turned their footsteps
in that direction and walked along slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This train doesn’t reach Moscow until morning,”
said Frank, “so we shall be able to get all the rest
we need en route. I am curious to know just how
we are to fall in with the esteemed count.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So am I,” Jack agreed, “but I guess the Emperor
of all the Russias has a few strings he can pull without
any one being the wiser. The thing that troubles
me is, will we be able to fool the count?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s our business to see that we do,” was Frank’s
reply. “By the way, talking about the count, do you
know that I think a whole lot of this gun the Czar
gave me? I wouldn’t want to lose it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Think you could hit anything with it?” queried
Jack with a smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I guess I wouldn’t miss very far.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I agree with you. Having seen you shoot a time
or two, I am willing to lay a small wager you will
come pretty close to anything you aim at. They
are pretty weapons, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am in hopes I don’t have to use it,” said Frank
seriously, “but I can tell by the feel of it that it is
to be depended on. Yes, it’s a pretty handy pocket
piece.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here we are at the station,” said Jack at this
juncture. “In the future we’ll do all our talking in
German or French—French while we believe we are
among friends, and German at other times. English
is dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank nodded his understanding.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll get the tickets,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He took from his pocket a roll of bills and extracted
one he felt sure—he couldn’t tell positively
for he knew almost nothing of Russian money—was
sufficient to pay for two tickets, and approaching the
window said “Two to Moscow” in French. The
agent passed out the tickets and Frank tendered the
bill. He accepted what change was passed to him
without a word and inquired the way to the train.
After some little trouble they found themselves in a
second-class compartment and settled back in their
seats as comfortably as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And here we shall stay until we get to Moscow,”
said Jack. “Then, if something hasn’t turned up,
we’ll go straight to the best hotel. We may trust
the Czar not to lose sight of us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Best plan, I guess,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>A short time later the train started. The two
lads, much to their relief, found they were to have
no fellow travelers in their compartment. They
conversed in low tones until the conductor came for
their tickets, but once that worthy had taken his departure,
Frank said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it’s a long ride, and not knowing what is
in store for us at the other end, I vote we try and
catch forty winks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m with you,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>They settled themselves comfortably and closed
their eyes. Five minutes later, as the train sped on
in the darkness, they slept peacefully, utterly oblivious
of the danger they were in or of what the morrow
might bring forth.</p>

<p class='c004'>How long they slept neither lad could tell, but it
seemed to each that he had hardly closed his eyes
when he was awakened by loud voices without. Both
were awake instantly and as instantly each recognized
the fact that the train was at a standstill.
Light streamed through the window.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must be Moscow,” muttered Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right you are,” Frank agreed. “But why all this
fuss on the outside.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know why nor what,” said Jack. “If
they would only talk a white man’s language we
might learn what it is all about.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or German,” Frank agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this moment the door to their compartment
was thrown rudely open and a uniformed figure—that
of a colonel of cavalry—appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack drew himself up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the meaning of this?” he demanded in
French. “Why do you force your way into our
compartment?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That,” said the officer, also in French, “you will
learn in good time. You are under arrest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Arrest!” cried Frank. “And what for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All in good time, all in good time,” said the officer
with a deprecating gesture. “Out here with
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“See here,” protested Jack, “I wish you to understand
that you are talking to two French gentlemen,
allies of Russia in this critical stage, and I must insist
that you be more choice in your words.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So?” queried the Russian with an evil leer. “Just
to put a stop to all this foolishness, I may as well
tell you that I know you for what you are. You are
both German spies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Spies?” echoed Frank. “I assure you, sir——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s no use,” declared the Russian. “You have
been followed for days now. We were warned of
your approach and instructed to arrest you both on
sight. You will come with me now, without further
talk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack said a few words in an aside to Frank. Immediately
the Russian officer produced a pair of revolvers,
with which he covered the two lads.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No foolishness,” he said quietly. “I have a
squad of my men out here. Will you come out, or
must I use force?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I assure you you are making a grave mistake,”
declared Jack, “but rather than cause unpleasantness,
we shall come with you until we are able to
prove our identities.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are sensible, sir,” returned the officer quietly.
“Alight, please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack stepped from the compartment first and
Frank directly behind him. Outside, a squad of
half-a-dozen men surrounded them and they were
marched away. They walked down several streets
and turned in toward a rather handsome appearing
building. Here they were led before a figure attired
in the uniform of a Russian general.</p>

<p class='c004'>This officer heard the report of his subordinate
and then commanded:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Relieve them of what weapons they may have.”</p>

<p class='c004'>An officer felt through their pockets and removed
the revolvers so recently given them by the Czar.
Then the general ordered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lock them up and see that they are kept safely.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the lads were marched down a long corridor,
then down a flight of long steps into inky
blackness; thence along another corridor and finally
into a low and narrow cell. Here they were locked
in and the officer and his men withdrew.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nice place this,” said Frank, after their captor
had taken his departure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rather,” agreed Jack dryly. “Doesn’t look to
me as though we were going to get very far with
this mission.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come now,” said Frank, “you don’t mean to tell
me you don’t see through this?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“See through what?” demanded Jack. “This
darkness? Couldn’t any one see through it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no,” said Frank. “I mean our arrest and
imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course I see through it,” said Jack. “We’ve
been spotted and the count has had us caught. Must
be a leak in the Czar’s palace some place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should say things are working out first rate,”
he said calmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you would. Maybe you can explain it to
me then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Easily. This is part of the Czar’s plan. Now,
if I am not greatly mistaken, it won’t be long before
our friend, the count, shows up to see whether we
are really spies; and if he is convinced we are, he’ll
want to hold a conversation with us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove! I believe you’re right,” declared Jack.
“In that event we must make the count believe we
are spies of the first water. I hope we don’t have
long to wait.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They didn’t.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later they heard footsteps coming
down the corridor. Their jailer approached, followed
by a huge stature of a man with a long flowing
black beard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Open the cell door,” commanded the big man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bet four cents that’s the count,” Frank whispered
very gently.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />THE COUNT EXPLAINS HIS PLANS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The lad was right.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Open that cell door,” commanded the big man
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other made no reply, but a key grated in the
lock. The big man entered the cell, then turned
upon the man who had unlocked the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Leave us!” he commanded sternly. “Have no
fear,” he added hastily, as he saw the man was
about to protest. “I have my revolver here,” and
he tapped his belt. “I can handle these two.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man made no further objection, but departed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The count whirled upon the two lads.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So!” he exclaimed. “I have captured two German
spies, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your Excellency,” said Jack quietly, “I assure
you we are not German spies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“O-ho!” laughed the big Russian. “They deny
it. O-ho!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank also deemed it best to keep up the pretense.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I assure you, your Excellency,” he said, “that
you are mistaken in us. We are French gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank purposely threw a slight German accent
into his voice and the big Russian noticed it immediately.</p>

<p class='c004'>“French! and with an accent like that?” he demanded.
“Come! where are the papers you carry?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Papers?” echoed Jack, in well simulated surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, papers. I said papers and I mean papers,”
declared the count. “Where are they?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think we are fools, that we carry papers
with us?” demanded Jack somewhat angrily, it
seemed to Count Blowinski.</p>

<p class='c004'>This answer rather pleased the count, for it gave
him the idea that he had two shrewd young men
before him. He lowered his voice suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come,” he said. “It is all right. I am Count
Blowinski. It is for me the papers you carry are
intended.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack glanced quickly about him and the move was
not lost upon the count. Still the lad seemed undecided
and protested his innocence in vigorous terms,
in which Frank joined. Count Blowinski laughed
softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I like you two,” he declared. “You are cautious,
which is a trait to be admired in these troublous
times. But I assure you I am the man for whom the
papers are intended. Give them to me. I shall see
that you are released and I shall have use for you
myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we could but be sure,” said Jack, “then we
could deliver our message.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is verbal, you mean?” demanded the count.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How else?” queried Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good, then tell me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you will prove to our satisfaction that you are
really Count Blowinski, we shall do so,” said Jack.
“I see it is useless to profess ignorance any longer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For answer the count stepped to the door of the
cell and raised his voice in a call for the jailer. The
latter hurried forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell these prisoners who I am,” ordered the
count.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are Count Blowinski, your Excellency,” replied
the man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” said the count. “Leave us again.” The
man retreated and again the count turned to the two
lads: “Are you satisfied now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly, your Excellency,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>He took off his coat, and ripped open the lining.
Then he produced a paper, which he passed to the
count. Jack did likewise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are in duplicate,” said Jack. “In case one
of us failed to get through, the other, it was felt,
would reach you safely.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Quickly Count Blowinski scanned the papers and
then tore them into little pieces and dropped the
bits into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” he said sternly, “if you will tell me why
you told me you carried a verbal message?”</p>

<p class='c004'>His words were a question and Frank replied
quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So that, in the event you were not really Count
Blowinski, you would not know that we carried
papers,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good! Good!” cried the Russian. “You are
shrewd. I shall be able to make use of you. I
suppose you know that the contents of these papers put
both of you at my disposal?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, your Excellency, we had not been so informed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it is true,” declared the count. “And your
courage and resourcefulness is commended to me.
Yes, I shall have use for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are at your service, your Excellency,” said
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The count moved toward the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall have to leave you here for a time,” he
said. “It may be an hour, it may be six. Things
cannot be done in a minute without arousing suspicion,
in spite of my rank. However, I shall have
you out as soon as I possibly can, for I would converse
with you further. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He passed out and again summoned the jailer,
whom he ordered to relock the door. This done,
the two moved away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, he swallowed it,” said Frank, after he was
sure the count was out of hearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should say he did,” Jack agreed. “I didn’t
imagine it would be so easy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nor I; but we have the hardest part of the work
still ahead of us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And we shall carry it to a successful conclusion,”
said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or know the reason why,” added Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was well within the specified time that a jailer
again approached the cell and commanded the two
lads to follow him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are you taking us?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Count Blowinski desires your presence,” replied
the guard.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads followed without further questioning.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were ushered into the count’s presence in
his own handsome apartments. They were rather
surprised when they found the count was not alone,
but their surprise was short lived, for after the guard
had taken his departure, Count Blowinski addressed
them immediately.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have this moment signed your pardons,” he
said. “I have told the military authorities, who are
under my supervision, that I have positive evidence
you are not German spies. My word goes here yet—and
will in the days to come, when the German
armies have occupied Moscow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The count swept his arm about the room, taking
in all the other figures in a single comprehensive gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>“These,” he said to the two lads, “are the men
who are with me in this undertaking. You may
speak plainly before them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads bowed to the circle of faces.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, your Excellency,” said Jack quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the way,” said the count, “how am I to address
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack smiled slightly as he replied, indicating
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My companion here as Lieutenant Maurice Depree
and myself as Lieutenant Raoul Santon, of the
French army.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” said the count. “Good for our work
here. But your real names?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are not to be mentioned in Moscow,” replied
Frank simply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And why?” demanded the count with a sudden
show of anger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because it is commanded,” returned Frank
firmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment it seemed that the count was about
to make an angry retort, but he checked himself and
after a moment smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A command,” he said, “is a command. It would
be well if others obeyed orders as well as you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He then presented each lad in turn to the various
men about him, and Frank and Jack were surprised
to learn that some men so high in the Russian service
were engaged in this gigantic German plot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The names of some,” thought Frank to himself,
“would startle the whole world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now,” said the count, “perhaps you can
throw a little light upon a subject we have been
trying to solve. First, of course, you know something
of what we are planning to do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A trifle,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall explain. Our plan is to gather together,
in Moscow first, such a number of men who are
dissatisfied with Russian rule, as to raise a hand for
the Kaiser. I may say without boasting that at this
moment I have the pledges of at least a hundred
Russian noblemen to use their influence and what
power they have to join when the time is ripe. There
is dissension among the troops, particularly those
who have been held here and in Petrograd—St. Petersburg
once more when German arms have been
victorious. Among high officers in the army we
have found recruits, as well as in the ranks. When
the time comes we shall strike, and when it does
come I have enough men at my command to capture
Moscow and hold it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, perhaps you have heard that the Czar will
visit Moscow next week?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank nodded, and then he took a long chance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was for that reason, so I am told,” he said,
“that we were sent here at this time. I can now give
you what verbal instructions I carry. I am commanded
to tell you that the time to strike is on the
last day of the Czar’s visit to Moscow, after which,
it is understood at home, he is going to the front.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good! Good!” cried Count Blowinski. “It is as
I told you, gentlemen,” and he gazed at the others in
the room. “Did I not tell you the time for action
had come? I said it when I first learned that two
German spies——” here he smiled—“had been captured.
So the time is almost here! Good!”</p>

<p class='c004'>There were nods and low murmurs of approval
from different parts of the room. Count Blowinski
swept the others with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The time has come for you to prove yourselves,”
he said sternly. “Let each of you go your way now
and report to me at this hour the day after tomorrow.
And remember, I am still the Czar’s right
hand. Should a single man betray me, I shall still
have the power to send him to Siberia. Be warned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He glared at the others, who now left the room
rapidly. The count signaled the two lads to remain
with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You gentlemen,” he said after the others had
gone, “shall remain as my guests. The freedom of
the town and the house is yours. By the Kaiser!
I am glad you have come. I was beginning to tire
of waiting. Will you join me in a glass of wine?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank was about to refuse, but Jack stayed him
with a look.</p>

<p class='c004'>“With pleasure, your Excellency,” the lad said
quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian clapped his hands and a servant appeared.
The count gave a command in Russian and
the man disappeared, only to reappear a few moments
later bearing a tray on which was wine and
glasses. The count filled the glasses, and as each
stood with his glass raised the count exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Confusion to Nicholas!”</p>

<p class='c004'>As the count threw back his head and drained
the glass, each lad was able to dispose of his wine
in a jardinière which stood nearby.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your Excellency,” said Frank, “if you would
be so kind as to put a room at our disposal, we would
rest for a brief while. Your Excellency may never
find it out, but a dungeon cell does not rest weary
bones.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To be sure,” said the count with a laugh. “I had
forgotten your recent hardship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He clapped his hands for his servants, then continued:
“No, Count Stephan Blowinski shall never
repose in a dungeon cell!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />THE BOYS MAKE PROGRESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The two following days passed without incident.
Frank and Jack remained in the palatial home of
Count Blowinski as honored guests. What excuse
the count had given his subordinates for releasing
them and giving the freedom of the house and of
the city itself, the lads did not know; it was sufficient
that he had done so. They went and came without
question.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was on the evening of the third day—shortly
before the supper hour—that Jack, passing the door
of the count’s private office, caught a word or two
from within that caused him to prick up his ears.
He stopped and listened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-night at eight, then,” came the words in a
voice he did not recognize.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-night at eight,” repeated Count Blowinski.
“Be there without fail. I expect a full attendance,
for it is quite likely that plans of importance will be
discussed. You know the password?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, your Excellency. ‘The Czar’ only spoken
in German.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly; and the knock?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Five sharp taps, a loud tap and two short taps.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. At eight then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack flitted silently down the hall and turned into
a room just as the door to the count’s quarters
opened. The lad was afraid to take the risk of trying
to get a look at the count’s visitor, for had he
been detected, he did not know what might happen.
He made his way to the quarters assigned him and
Frank, where he sat down to await his chum’s return.</p>

<p class='c004'>Seven o’clock came and Frank did not put in an
appearance. Seven-fifteen, and still no sign of him.
Jack began to grow uneasy. Seven-thirty, and he
had not returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pshaw! I guess he can take care of himself,”
muttered Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>He donned his heavy cloak, picked up his hat and
descended to the street. There, in the shadow of
the house, he took his stand. A few moments later,
Count Blowinski appeared in the doorway. A moment
later the count’s large automobile drew up.
The Russian descended the steps and entered the
car.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the machine moved off, Jack rushed from his
hiding place, and by a sprint, caught hold of the
rear of the car and pulled himself up behind. The
machine continued on its way for perhaps fifteen
minutes. Jack kept careful note of the direction,
that he might find his way back safely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the driver turned the car into a dark and
narrow street and reduced his speed. Jack dropped
lightly to the ground and dashed to the shelter of
the dingy buildings that lined the walks. Muffled
in his huge coat, he knew he ran little risk of detection.</p>

<p class='c004'>A short distance up the narrow street the car
stopped and Count Blowinski alighted. Immediately
the auto turned and sped in the direction from
which it had come.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack slouched toward the count.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter took one look at the approaching figure,
and then, apparently satisfied, turned on his heel
and walked rapidly up the street. Jack followed a
considerable distance behind but still close enough
to make sure he would not lose sight of the count.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before a single story building, even more dingy
looking than the rest, the count paused. One swift
glance he gave about him, and not perceiving Jack
some distance behind—as the lad had slunk close to
the shelter of the house, he disappeared down a
flight of stairs into the basement.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack moved forward more rapidly now.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad had noticed that before Count Blowinski
descended the stairway he had settled his heavy fur
cap more firmly upon his head, apparently to conceal
his features. Jack did likewise.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the head of the steps—at the same point where
the count had paused momentarily—Jack also
paused for a second. He thrust both hands into the
pockets of his great coat and made sure that his
revolvers were ready. One quick glance he cast
about him and started; for he felt sure that he had
perceived a form lurking in the shadows some distance
back.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was too late to hesitate now; so, drawing a
long breath, Jack descended the steps.</p>

<p class='c004'>Below he expected to find a door, where it would
be necessary to give the knock he had heard mentioned
in Count Blowinski’s rooms earlier in the
evening; but there was no door, or if there were, it
was standing open. At any rate Jack did not see a
door and he passed into the darkness beyond.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was inky black inside, and Jack walked forward
slowly, one hand touching the wall on the side as
he advanced. Suddenly he brought up against a
solid wall. He felt along in the darkness and found
that the passage turned to the left. He continued
along it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he stumbled. His foot had struck something.
He leaned down to investigate and discovered
that the something was nothing more than a
flight of stairs. He mounted them as rapidly as the
darkness would permit.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the top he came to another passageway, leading
off to the right. Down this he walked in the
darkness for fifty paces and then brought up against
another solid substance. He stretched out his hands
on each side of him. There was no turn in the
passageway. Apparently the obstruction that barred
his progress was a door.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here was where it would be necessary to knock
for admittance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack did not hesitate. Five sharp taps he gave,
followed by a single loud tap, and then two sharp
taps.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later the door swung inward a trifle
and a head showed itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The word?” the man questioned in a deep voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Czar,” replied Jack firmly in German.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Enter,” said the voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door swung back farther.</p>

<p class='c004'>Settling his cap firmly on his head, Jack once
again felt of his revolvers and stepped inside.
Before him another long passageway stretched out.
Apparently the man who had opened the door at the
lad’s knock was some distance from the rendezvous.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack asked no questions, but walked ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several more turns and another flight of stairs
he traversed before bringing up before another door.
Here again he found it was necessary to knock, but
he ran the gauntlet safely and a few moments later
found himself inside, thinking to himself as he gazed
upon the circle of men who sat about the room:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly they are careful enough not to be discovered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Within the room there were fully half a hundred
men gathered about. The room was only dimly
lighted and it was next to impossible for Jack to
make out the features even of the man immediately
next to him on either side. In spite of this, however,
the lad was careful to keep his coat well up around
his chin and his cap down over his ears. This attracted
no undue attention, however, for it seemed
to be the purpose of every man in the room to keep
his identity hidden.</p>

<p class='c004'>Apparently the meeting, or whatever it was, had
not been called to order yet, for the men were simply
sitting or standing about quietly. They seemed
to be awaiting the arrival of some one.</p>

<p class='c004'>And a few moments later the some one came.</p>

<p class='c004'>A big man he was, taller and heavier than Count
Blowinski himself, and he walked into the room
with the air of a man born to command. He passed
to the far end of the room, where he turned to face
the others. Count Blowinski approached and stood
by his side. The faces of these two alone were
plainly visible.</p>

<p class='c004'>A Russian was Count Blowinski, it could be told
at first glance, but Jack experienced a shock of surprise
when he obtained his first clear view of the
other man. The latter was a German. There could
be no doubting his Teutonic features. Jack wondered
how he could roam about Moscow at large
without being picked up by the Russian authorities.</p>

<p class='c004'>Count Blowinski was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gentlemen,” he said, “I have the pleasure to inform
you that the time to strike has come. To-morrow
the Czar comes to Moscow. I shall expect
each one of you to do your duty. There is no need
to discuss our plans. Each man here knows the
work that has been assigned to him. In my pocket
are all your names. The man who fails shall have
me to reckon with and I assure you that Siberia is
an unpleasant country.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Czar comes to Moscow to-morrow only with
his personal bodyguard. He is relying upon me to
furnish the men who shall protect him. I shall do
so, though in a way that possibly will surprise him.
That is, I shall do so with your assistance. If you
are still with me, you will please say ‘aye.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aye!” came in subdued voices from the other
conspirators. Even Jack joined in.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We shall seize the Czar,” continued the count,
“as he addresses his troops on the palace grounds.
Aside from the Czar’s personal bodyguard, the
troops will be mine, carefully selected by you. I
shall expect them to do their work.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Herr von Louden here tells me that, half an hour
after the time appointed for the Czar to address my
troops, a fleet of half a hundred German airplanes,
together with a score of Zeppelins, will appear over
the city. At the same moment, a German fleet,
which has pushed through the Baltic to the Gulf
of Finland, will force an entrance and bombard
Petrograd. Further south, the allied Teutonic
armies will begin a gigantic offensive at almost the
same moment. The Russian troops will be forced
back upon all sides. The people will cry for peace,
and I, having assumed my new role under the protection
of his Majesty Wilhelm II of Germany, shall
give them peace. They will thank me, and you,
gentlemen, for bringing peace to our troubled country.
That is all, except that Herr von Louden is
present to-night to vouch for the truth of my words
and to reassure you that the Emperor of Germany
will keep his royal word.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The German then spoke a few words, after which
Count Blowinski said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, if there are no remarks, I shall declare
this meeting adjourned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There were no remarks. Apparently no man
present had anything to say.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But before you go, to begin your respective
tasks,” said the count, “I shall ask each man present
to pass before me and remove his hat, that I may
make sure there is no traitor nor spy among us to-night.
I should know the face of every man present
and I should know whether he is entitled to be
here. You will please walk before me on your way
out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” muttered Jack to himself. “I’m
in for it now. I am sure to be recognized and the
count will hardly accept any explanation I may
make. Worse, if discovered, I shall be unable to
give the warning and the plot will succeed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad’s lips set grimly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is always a fighting chance,” he told himself
quietly, remembering the remark Lord Hastings
had so recently made to Frank. “Well, they’ll know
I have been here before I go down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He thrust his hands into his pockets and grasped
a revolver securely with each. Then he followed
the line of men who were passing before Count
Blowinski.</p>

<p class='c004'>The single light in the room was right above the
count’s head and it fell squarely upon each man’s
head as he passed before the count. Behind Jack
came other men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />THE FIGHT IN THE PASSAGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A form pressed Jack closely from behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Careful!” said a low voice that the lad recognized
with a start.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack half wheeled and muttered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Frank! What——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sh-h-h,” was Frank’s response, for it was really
he, and added quickly: “When the light goes out,
duck and make for the door. I’ll be behind you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack said nothing, but awaited developments as he
moved still nearer Count Blowinski. He held himself
tense, ready for anything that might transpire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank held his right hand carelessly in his pocket
as he moved slowly forward behind Jack. The long
line of men were passing through the door, but there
were still many more behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>A close observer now would have seen the right
side of Frank’s great coat rise slowly. The hand
within was pulling it up. Suddenly it flashed up still
more suddenly and there came a sharp report. There
was a sound of crashing glass and the room was immediately
plunged into darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through his overcoat, Frank had shot out the
light!</p>

<p class='c004'>At the moment he had pressed the trigger Frank
had reached forth his left hand and clasped Jack by
the arm. Then he leaped in the direction of the
door dragging Jack after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quick!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment after the single shot, there was a
deathly stillness in the room and in that moment
Frank and Jack almost reached the door. Almost
but not quite. At a far end of the room a match
flared up. Frank, who had now drawn his revolver
from his pocket, raised it quickly and fired again.
The match went out.</p>

<p class='c004'>But this second shot had betrayed the lads’ new
position to the other occupants of the room. A terrific
roar went up and several revolvers cracked
sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Frank and Jack had been too quick for the
others. Immediately Frank had fired, both had
dropped to the floor. Then rising they sailed into
the crowd of Russians before them with their hands,
striking out right and left.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was in this kind of fighting that Jack showed
up best. Though his wits were no quicker than
Frank’s, his courage no greater, his blows were
heavier and his weight bore all before it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quicker than it takes to tell it he had cleared a
passage to the door, and reaching back, he grabbed
Frank by the arm and pulled him through after him.
Unfortunately, the door closed the wrong way, so he
could not close it after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Run!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank needed no urging and darted after his
chum, at the same time crying out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look out for the steps, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Jack did not need this warning. Always observant,
he had measured the distance from the steps
to the door as he entered, and now he drew in the
darkness a scant three paces from the steps. He
felt for them with his foot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” he said to Frank, who had stopped
when he collided with his friend. “Fifteen steps
down, then run to the left.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank followed instructions without question.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Jack came into contact with a figure in
the darkness. The lad shoved him to one side and
the two darted by. Other figures now blocked the
passage. They were the men who had passed out
ahead of the lads.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were hoarse cries of alarm and surprise;
but unheeding these, the two boys ran on. The advantage
was theirs, for the Russians, although realizing
something was wrong, could not see them
and did not know the causes of all the trouble were
so near.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack turned into the last passageway
safely. And there it became light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before the door at which stood the first guard was
a light. The guard himself, attracted by the sounds
of commotion from behind, faced the lads as they
turned into the passage, a drawn revolver in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Halt!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>Without pausing in his stride, Frank raised his
own revolver and fired around Jack’s side. The
Russian dropped.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack pulled up before the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pull it open!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack laid hold of the knob and pulled. The door
did not budge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurry!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Came the sounds of running footsteps from behind,
loud cries and shouts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Jack wrenched at the knob, and it came
away in his fingers. Jack looked at the knob in
dismay.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s broken,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>At that moment the first Russian hove in sight.
He saw the lads at the same moment Frank perceived
him. Both raised their revolvers simultaneously,
but Frank was the first to fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blow the lock off the door!” cried Frank. “I’ll
hold ’em back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack placed the muzzle of his revolver to the
lock and pulled the trigger. Still the door would
not open.</p>

<p class='c004'>A second Russian came into sight in the rear.
Again Frank fired with excellent result.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Open the door!” he cried to Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It won’t open,” Jack shouted back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blow the lock off!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It didn’t come off!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Try it again!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack did so; and still the door refused to budge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess I don’t hit it in the right place,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, turn around here and do a little shooting,”
said Frank. “Here they come. They’ll try to rush
us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We should be able to hold them,” replied Jack
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>He fell to one knee, and holding one revolver in
his left hand by his side, rested his right elbow on
his right knee.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two Russians appeared around the corner at the
same moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crack! Crack!</p>

<p class='c004'>Just two shots and the Russians toppled over.
A second pair met the same fate. Another man did
not appear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You guard this end a moment and I’ll have a try
at the door,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank placed his revolver against the lock and
fired. Immediately the lad swung the door open.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fire a couple of shots to hold them back,” he
cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>He suited the action to the word and Jack followed
suit. Then both lads sprang through the
open door into the darkness. They ran down the
narrow hall as fast as their legs would carry them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Watch the steps!” cried Frank again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack pulled up at the edge of the stairs safely
and they descended them rapidly. Footsteps from
behind indicated that the Russians had discovered
their absence and were in full chase again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Down the dark passageway ran the lads at full
speed and at last came to the outside. Quickly they
climbed the few steps to the street and ran down the
thoroughfare.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s where we shall have to hustle,” shouted
Frank. “They can spread out here and pick us off.
Double around the first corner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They did so and with better fortune than they
could possibly have hoped for; for not a Russian
emerged from the house while they were in sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Around the next corner, and the next and the
next,” shouted Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack obeyed; and after turning half-a-dozen corners
the lads felt sure they had shaken off their pursuers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to get away from here,” said Frank
as they slowed down. “Count Blowinski, being in
command, will have the police and military
authorities scouring the neighborhood. If we are picked
up in this part of town, we will be no better than if
we had been caught in the house.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning the next corner, Jack came to a halt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look!” he said and pointed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank glanced in the direction indicated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” he said, “all I see is an automobile.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly,” replied Jack, “and that is the thing
that will get us to some other part of the city quicker
than our legs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right you are,” said Frank. “No time to lose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They approached the car.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello,” said Frank suddenly, “it’s occupied.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A figure of a man had appeared suddenly in the
front seat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’ll soon be unoccupied,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank made no reply and they approached the
machine.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack walked directly up to the man and spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will oblige me by getting out of there,” he
said in German.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man understood, but he had no mind to give
up his property so easily. He sought to temporize.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is my machine,” he said. “By what
right——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the right of necessity,” said Jack calmly.
“He stretched forth a long arm and grasped the
man by the collar and lifted him to the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stay there,” he said. “All right, Frank. Hop
in and start her off. I’ll keep an eye on this fellow
until you are ready.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank leaped in the front seat quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Luck!” he exclaimed. “A self starter. I was
afraid we would have to crank her up. Leave him
there and climb aboard.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack thrust the man from him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stay away,” he warned and leaped into the car.</p>

<p class='c004'>But this Russian was no coward and he determined
to fight for his property. He produced a
revolver.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stop and get out of there!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack looked at him and sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poor fellow,” he said. “I guess it must be done.
All right,” he called to the man. “You’ve got the
drop on us. We’ll get out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He suited the action to the word and got to the
ground deliberately and without haste. He looked
at the Russian calmly, and the man lowered his
weapon. It was the moment for which Jack had
been waiting, and his right hand shot out with amazing
speed and an aim that was true.</p>

<p class='c004'>Struck squarely upon the point of the jaw, the
Russian crumpled up on the ground without a sound.
Jack climbed back in the machine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, Frank,” he said. “Let’s go.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />FRANK TAKES A JOURNEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Whew!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank dropped his heavy coat on the bed and
turned to Jack with a wry smile. Jack smiled back
at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I recognize your feelings,” he said. “Pretty
close and no mistake.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should say. Wonder if our good friend the
count has returned yet?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t imagine so. Guess he’ll be up half the
night seeking some trace of the intruders who were
so unkind as to disturb his meeting and shoot up
some of his henchmen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hope he doesn’t look here for them,” remarked
Frank. “I want to get some sleep.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To tell the truth, I wouldn’t be surprised if he
hunted us up the moment he comes in,” said Jack.
“He’ll want to tell us what is coming off to-morrow,
so that we may be on hand. Nice fellow, the count.
Seems to like us quite a bit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So he does,” was Frank’s rejoinder. “Can’t say
that I return the feeling, however.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Well, we’ll turn in, anyhow; perhaps the
count won’t be so unkind as to disturb us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold on now,” said Frank. “There is something
else to be decided on before we can sleep.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we haven’t communicated with the Czar
yet, and he will arrive here to-morrow. How are
we going to warn him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say! That’s not such an easy question, is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess not. The count and his crowd will
meet the Czar at the station, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we can be there, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but if we try to give the warning there it
will spoil everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then what are we going to do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the question. Let me think a bit and try
and do a little yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads became silent, considering the situation.
It was Frank who finally broke the silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got it!” he declared.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, let’s have it,” returned Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. It’s very simple, too. It’s still early.
There is a train to Petrograd at midnight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So there is,” said Jack. “But you forget that
it won’t get you there in time to catch the Czar before
he leaves Petrograd.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no, I don’t,” said Frank. “I have been
studying maps and things since we have been here,
and I have found a certain town that is a railway
division point. All trains stop there to change engines.
I’ll get off there and wait for the Czar’s
train to come through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hm-mm,” said Jack. “That will be some time
early in the morning. If the Czar has arisen, all
well and good. If not, you’ll have a hard time getting
to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Something must be left to chance,” returned
Frank quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So it must,” agreed Jack. “Well, in lieu of a
better plan, that will have to do. Now will you go,
or do you want me to go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seeing that it’s my plan, I guess I’ll go,” said
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. Then you had better hurry. I’ll tell
the count that you have disappeared. It wouldn’t do
for him to find you here to-night and not in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right you are,” agreed Frank. “Well, I hate
to go, for, to tell the truth the bed looks awfully
inviting. However, it’s got to be done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He slipped into his overcoat quickly and extended
a hand to Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just in case anything happens,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack grasped the hand and squeezed it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll bide here quietly,” he said. “I’ll probably
be at the station when the royal train pulls in to-morrow.
You’ll probably come back with the Czar.
If you get a chance, tip me the wink.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t get a chance,” said Frank, “for I will
keep very much out of sight. If the count should
see me in the Czar’s retinue he would smell a mouse
immediately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove! so he would,” agreed Jack. “Well,
I’ll find you some place when the excitement is
over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right. Now I’ll have to hustle or the estimable
count is likely to return before I make my disappearance.
I’ll have considerable time to kill at the
station.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll go to the door with you,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better not. Just sit tight where you are.” Frank
moved toward the door. “Well, so long,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-bye and good luck,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks; the same to you. Your position is
more ticklish than mine. You’ll have to explain
my strange absence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I guess I can do that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So do I. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank closed the door behind him and hurried
from the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Left alone, Jack immediately prepared for bed.
There was nothing that he could do now and he
had determined to get what rest he could, for he
realized that the events of the morrow were likely
to be very strenuous. He put out the light and
climbed into bed. Five minutes later he was fast
asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>How long he was asleep he did not know, but
he was awakened by a pounding at the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come in,” he called sleepily, when he was fully
awake.</p>

<p class='c004'>Count Blowinski entered the room and switched
on the light.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, in bed?” he said. He glanced at the lad
and then added: “Where is our friend Lieutenant—Lieutenant
Depree?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He smiled at the name.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove!” said Jack, sitting up in bed and looking
around sleepily. “He hasn’t come in yet. Wonder
what can have happened to him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I guess he’ll show up in the morning,” was
the count’s reply. “He is probably out looking
about the town.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably,” agreed Jack, with a laugh. “However,
he’s old enough to look out for himself. Did
you want to see me about anything particular?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, yes. I wanted to tell you that the time
for action has come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good!” Jack exclaimed eagerly. “When?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-morrow? You mean the Czar will be here
to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; and if my plans do not miscarry I shall
be master of Moscow before the sun has set—and
within the month Russia will have declared peace
with Germany.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is indeed good news,” declared Jack. “But
you are sure there is no danger of your plans going
wrong?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That,” said the count, “is why I have stopped
in your room to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a brief moment Jack’s heart stood still and
he thought to himself:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can he have discovered anything?” Aloud he
said: “I shall be glad to do anything in my power
for the cause.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was sure of it,” said the count, and Jack’s
fears fled. “Now the situation is this: To-night
we—myself and the men who are with me in this
undertaking—held a meeting, where I gave my instructions
to proceed with the coup to-day. Just
after I declared the meeting adjourned, I decided
that I would have a look at the face of every man
present. They were passing before me when there
was a shot and the light went out. A fight followed.
There were two spies in the meeting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t tell me!” exclaimed Jack. “And
have you any idea how they gained admittance?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not the slightest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it doesn’t matter, I suppose,” said Jack
deprecatingly. “They are dead now, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Count Blowinski slowly; “that is
the trouble; they escaped.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Escaped!” Jack repeated incredulously. “What!
you allowed them to escape?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Count Blowinski grew somewhat angry.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We didn’t let them escape purposely, you may
be sure of that,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Possibly not,” admitted Jack, “but how many
of you were there in the room?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, enough to have taken them,” returned the
count, his face somewhat red, “if that’s what you
are driving at. There were possibly fifty of us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fifty of you and you let two men escape?”
ejaculated Jack. “Count, I fear for the success
of your plans.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But this was unavoidable,” protested the count,
apparently thinking much of Jack’s good opinion.
“They acted so suddenly and they had us at a disadvantage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack decided that he had wounded the count
enough. So he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can see, count, that you were at some disadvantage.
But now that these men have escaped, are
you not afraid that your plans may be betrayed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not at all,” was the reply. “I have taken all
precautions. I have ordered that no messages be
accepted by telegraph companies; I have thrown
a cordon around the town through which no man
could pass; I have notified the railroads that no
man without a passport signed by me be allowed
to leave the city.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have done well, count,” declared Jack.
“But your man may slip through. Take me or
my friend for example. We both carry passports
signed by yourself. Why not another?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because, besides the passports held by yourselves,
I have signed no other.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then your plans are in no danger,” said Jack
briefly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not. But the reason I have disturbed
you to-night is that I would give you the privilege
of being on my staff when I go to meet the Czar
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall be delighted, count, and I thank you for
your thoughtfulness. It will give me pleasure.
But, by the way, count, supposing the Czar comes
in force?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, but he will not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You cannot be positive on that score. He may
send thousands of troops ahead of his special train.
How many men can you count on?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Enough, I believe. Say five thousand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hardly enough to seize the Czar if he comes
properly attended,” said Jack dryly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is enough,” protested the count. “It must
be enough. I cannot fail now. To do so would
lose me favor with the German emperor, as you
know. And I should be discredited here. There
would be nothing left for me in Russia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nor any other place, count,” added Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, nor any other place,” said the count slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned and left the room without another

</div>

<p class='c003'>When Frank left Jack he made all haste toward
the railway station and purchased a ticket for Klaw,
the railway division point he had mentioned to
Jack. It still lacked an hour to midnight and Frank
paced up and down in the station. The train left
at twelve sharp and Frank ascertained that it
would reach Klaw five hours later, barring accidents.</p>

<p class='c004'>At fifteen minutes to twelve Frank took his seat
in a first-class compartment. Ten minutes later
a guard approached and demanded to see his passport.
Frank showed it to him. The guard departed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Soon the train pulled out and when it was well
under way Frank composed himself to sleep; nor
did he awake until the train was on the outskirts
of Klaw.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad alighted the moment the train came to
a stop and went immediately to a hotel a short
distance away. He did not wish to attract attention
by making inquiries concerning the Czar’s
train, so he idled about the hotel, where he was
fortunate enough to hear what he had expected.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Czar’s train, I understand, will pass
through soon after seven o’clock,” he heard one
man tell another.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was all Frank wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fifteen minutes before seven Frank returned to
the station, where he loitered about. A large
crowd had assembled, for word of the Emperor’s
coming had traveled swiftly and the people had
turned out to catch a glimpse of “The white
father.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a quarter after seven when the guards
began pushing the crowd back from the track. It
was a sign that the royal train was near. Frank
edged his way through the crowd as well as he could
without drawing attention to himself. The lad
realized that the surest way to spoil his plans was
to attract the attention of the guards. Should they
see that he was apparently too anxious to get close,
they would immediately arrest him and hustle him
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll have to wait until the train stops and then
take a chance,” he told himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Came the sound of a shrill whistle from up the
track. The Czar’s special was approaching and
the crowd cheered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two minutes later the train came to a stop.</p>

<p class='c004'>The guards and what troops had been summoned
were now hard put to it to keep the crowd back.
Several times they charged the crowd with drawn
sabers, so close to the train did they push. And
then suddenly the crowd became silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door to a compartment which bore the royal
arms opened suddenly. Instantly two footmen
stepped forward, one to either side. Three men
alighted, all garbed in military costume. The last
to alight was Czar Nicholas and again there was a
mighty roar from the crowd.</p>

<p class='c004'>For several moments the cheering continued and
then died away as the Czar raised a hand. “The
little white father” was going to address his people
and the people became silent, that they might
lose no word.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quietly they listened as their Emperor addressed
them in a few well chosen words; and how they
cheered when he had concluded! Then the Czar
turned to his two companions and the three walked
up and down the platform.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank now found himself in the front line of
the crowd; but armed guards separated him from
the Czar himself, and the lad knew that it would
be instant death should he attempt to approach the
Russian Emperor. As they passed in front of him,
however, less than thirty yards away, Frank made
out that one of the men with the Czar was Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>He raised his voice and called in English: “Lord
Hastings!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The three figures stopped in their tracks and
gazed quickly about.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank repeated the cry: “Lord Hastings!”</p>

<p class='c004'>By this time guards had rushed toward Frank
and seized him. Apparently they believed he was
attempting to create a disturbance, for they could
not understand his words.</p>

<p class='c004'>This commotion attracted the eyes of the Czar
and Lord Hastings, who moved close to see what
was going on. Lord Hastings uttered a sudden
exclamation of surprise and turned to the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is Frank Chadwick, my second officer,” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So,” said the Czar. “Then I shall have him
brought here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He gave a command to one of his officers and
the latter approached the spot where Frank was
struggling in the grasp of half-a-dozen guards.
The officer thrust the men right and left, saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall take command of this man. His Majesty
desires to question him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Immediately the guards fell back, as did the
crowd, which had pushed forward to see what was
going on and to lend a hand if it became necessary
to quiet a man who had dared to raise his voice
in the presence of the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank breathed a sigh of relief as the Russian
officer took charge of him. He knew that he had
been successful. He approached the Russian Emperor
and his own commander with a smile on his
face.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings was about to speak, but the Czar
forestalled him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So!” he exclaimed. “This is the manner in
which you perform a mission for the Emperor. I
send you to Moscow and I find you in Klaw. How
do you account for that, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have come to warn you, your Majesty,” said
Frank quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Warn me? Warn me of what? I had expected
word from you before this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We have known nothing definite before,” was
Frank’s reply, “nor have we had the opportunity
of warning you. The plot against your Majesty
has come to a head and the coup is to be sprung
to-day by Count Blowinski.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So?” said the Czar again. “And what kind of
a plot, pray?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are to be seized by Count Blowinski’s
troops, your Majesty, as you address them on the
palace drill grounds.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what if I am surrounded by my own personal
body guard, with twenty thousand of my own
troops within call?” asked the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then your Majesty will be perfectly safe,” returned
Frank quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar suddenly laughed aloud and turning to
Lord Hastings slapped him heartily on the back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ha, my lord,” he said. “Your young friend
here feared that I would venture into the lion’s
den without weapons. He has come to warn me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have done the best I can, your Majesty,” said
Frank, with offended dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar was quick to notice the change in the
lad’s tone and he at once felt the reason.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come, my lad, I didn’t mean to offend you,”
he exclaimed. “It is just my way, as Lord Hastings
here, who knows me well, will tell you. I am deeply
your debtor, and your friend’s. By the way, where
is he?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Still in the count’s home, your Majesty. We
figured it would be unwise for both of us to leave.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see,” said the Czar. “Long heads, as you
Britishers would say, Lord Hastings. But come,
our train is waiting. We shall continue our journey
into the lair of my dear friend Count Blowinski.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar laid a hand on Frank’s shoulder and
guided him toward the royal carriage. At the door,
he turned to the only officer who accompanied him
besides Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“General Rushtriki,” he said, “this young British
officer and myself have important matters to discuss.
He will take your place in my carriage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, your Majesty,” protested the astonished
officer, “I—there——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never mind, general,” said the Czar. “I shall
have my way in this; and if there is no other place
for you aboard this train, well, then I guess you
will have to remain here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall find another place, sire,” returned the
general, with ruffled dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stalked majestically away and entered another
compartment.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar climbed back in his compartment and
motioned Lord Hastings and Frank to follow him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” he said, when he was comfortably seated
and the train had resumed its interrupted journey,
“now you shall tell me all about yourself, what you
have been doing and what you have learned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank plunged into the account of their adventures.
When he told of Jack’s appearance in the
den of the conspirators, the Czar was moved to
ask:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And how did you find your way there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, your Majesty,” returned the lad, “I overheard
a conversation in one of the hotels where I
chanced to stop; and as it was too late to return
and acquaint Jack with what I had learned, I took
it upon myself to follow the men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see,” smiled the Czar. “Then you were undoubtedly
surprised to see your friend there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The conversation languished now; and soon the
Czar fell asleep. Frank took this opportunity of
having a few words with Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then the Czar will not trust himself entirely
to the count’s troops, sir?” the lad asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed he will not,” said Lord Hastings. “He
wanted to add a thousand men to his personal bodyguard
and only consented to adding the thousands
upon my suggestion, backed up by his ministers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And there are really twenty thousand men
coming, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are. Following this train, at ten-minute
intervals, are twenty more, each carrying a thousand
men. They will not reach Moscow for an hour
after the royal train arrives. Then they will be
disembarked rapidly and marched to the palace,
where the Czar is to rest before addressing the
count’s troops. This, too, is my idea, for I figured
that if there were to be any break it would be at
that moment. A man engaged in treachery always
plays to the spectacular. Then, too, if I were
wrong, it could make no difference if the troops
were there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then your plan is not to let the count know the
Czar’s troops have arrived until the time for action
comes, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Had I been figuring this thing out, I couldn’t
have done better myself,” said Frank modestly.
“We seem to have planned just right, sir. There
is only one thing I am sorry for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That I shall have to remain behind while the
Czar goes to the palace.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because, if the count saw me back with the
Czar he would suspect.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s true,” replied Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, sir,” said Frank, “if you will speak a word
to his Majesty, perhaps he will grant me permission
to accompany the troops that follow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The answer for this question came from an unexpected
source. The Czar had opened his eyes in
time to hear the lad’s words, and replied:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shall have the permission.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he turned to Lord Hastings and added
with a smile. “Look from the window! You will
see that we have arrived in the den of the lion. Behold
the city of Moscow, where my dear friend
Count Blowinski awaits my arrival with aching
jaws.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br />THE TRAP IS SPRUNG.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Troops, troops, troops. Hundreds, even thousands
of men marching through the streets of
Moscow drew the eyes of the populace. From the
railroad station they emerged in squadrons and regiments;
and the roads of all lay in the same direction—toward
the palace.</p>

<p class='c004'>Czar Nicholas and his retinue had arrived two
hours earlier and were even now in the palace. It
still lacked an hour of the time when the Czar was
to make his address from the palace steps to Count
Blowinski’s own men, but these were gathered
about the palace in dense masses.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first regiment of troops to leave the railroad
station and move toward the palace attracted little
attention, nor did the second; but as the men continued
to stream along word of their coming finally
reached the ear of Count Blowinski.</p>

<p class='c004'>That worthy, at the moment in consultation with
some of his fellow-conspirators, among whom was
Jack, became greatly excited when the first word
reached him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can it be possible that the Czar has an inkling
of our plans?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack took it upon himself to reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is hardly likely, count. I should judge that
the presence of troops here at this time has no
peculiar significance. Rather, their presence is
probably part of a prearranged plan to have them go
to the front. Perhaps the Czar intends to go with
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It may be as you say,” was the reply, “but my
messenger informs me that they are surrounding
the palace, hemming my own men in, as though
purposely.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It does look a bit odd,” Jack agreed. “But if
you are afraid to go through with your plans now,
count, why not postpone the coup?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must be done now or never,” replied the
count decisively. “A delay would prove fatal. If
it comes to the worst, I shall abandon my plan of
seizing the Emperor and shoot him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack gave a start. This was more than he had
bargained for; and he realized that if the count
really determined to put this latter plan into execution,
there was no time to give the warning. The
lad also realized that, in the event the count did
try to assassinate the Czar, he, himself, was the
only person who could hope to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack determined, therefore, to stick close to
Blowinski; and as he accompanied the count and
his staff to the palace grounds to meet the Czar,
he felt more certain at every step that the count’s
last plan was the one to be feared.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the large open space in front of the palace
stood Blowinski’s own men; but even from where
he stood, Jack could see the still more dense bodies
of the Czar’s troops hemming in those of the
count. The lad could discern their attitude of
hushed expectancy and he felt certain that their
officers had their commands.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s shoot or nothing,” the lad told himself,
and he followed the count closely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Count Blowinski approached the Czar and
the latter extended a hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Welcome, your Majesty,” cried the count, and
falling to his knee he took the hand and pressed
his lips to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am glad to see you, Count,” replied Czar
Nicholas. “A fine body of men you have here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, sire! They are indeed a likely body
of men and they would have you say a few words
to them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The count now presented the others of his retinue
to the Czar, and followed his majesty to the top
of the palace steps, as one befitting his rank and
station.</p>

<p class='c004'>There, he turned and surveyed the crowd below—a
host of uniformed figures. He spoke a few
words to them himself, and announced that the Czar
would address them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the count fell back a trifle, as the Czar advanced.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack watched the big Russian closely, noting that
Blowinski’s hand rested upon his belt, where was
exposed the butt of a revolver. Jack’s hand rested
in his coat pocket and his fingers gripped his own
weapon firmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish Frank were here,” he muttered. “I am
not certain of my own aim.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the Czar began to speak and a hush fell
over the vast assemblage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Soldiers!” said the Czar. “It gives me happiness
to address you; and it would give me ever
more happiness, were it not for one thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the Czar paused and his gaze went to the
troops farther back, his own men, whom he knew
could be trusted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack saw the officers there exhorting their men
to some sort of action as the Czar continued: “Yes,
it would give me greater happiness did I not know
that there are traitors among you—men who would
betray me to the enemy. I——”</p>

<p class='c004'>What else the Czar might have said was lost in
two sharp revolver reports. For a moment thereafter
there was a deathly silence; followed by a
tremendous uproar and the sharp crack, crack of
rifles.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack, his eye ever keen, had been watching Count
Blowinski like a hawk. As the emperor spoke of
traitors, the lad saw the count’s form stiffen. Then
the big Russian suddenly whipped out his revolver
and fired at the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Jack had acted just as promptly. As he saw
the count’s revolver leap forth, the lad jerked out
his own weapon. Hardly taking time to aim, but
breathing a fervent prayer, Jack pressed the trigger
a moment before the count’s finger tightened on the
trigger of his revolver.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was not the space of a second between
the two sharp reports, but Jack’s revolver spoke the
fraction of a second before that of the count.</p>

<p class='c004'>Count Blowinski staggered back. The bullet
from Jack’s revolver had struck him in the shoulder,
but his finger had already tightened on the trigger,
discharging his weapon. But his aim had been
deflected by Jack’s bullet and the missile went wide
of its mark.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before he could fire again, had such been his intention,
Jack had leaped forward and his powerful
fingers were clasped about the big Russian’s throat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The force of Jack’s spring had been so great
that he bore the big man to the floor. At the same
time he cried to the Czar:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Back inside, quick, your Majesty!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But the lad need not have spoken; for at the
sound of the first shot, others of the Czar’s personal
retinue had seized their Emperor and borne him
forcibly away. Then the crack of rifles filled the
air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under the command of their officers, trapped
though they were, the disloyal Russian troops turned
to give battle to the loyal forces who surrounded
them on all sides.</p>

<p class='c004'>So terrific, however, were the volleys poured in
on them from beyond, one after another, and so
fast did they drop, that their resistance was but
momentary. Yet during the time that it took them
to lay down their arms and cry for quarter, fully
a thousand of them were shot down.</p>

<p class='c004'>Immediately thereafter, the commander of the
loyal forces gave the command to advance, and the
men came forward at the double, thrusting to right
and left with their swords and long bayonets among
the now unarmed men.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack, having choked Count Blowinski into unconsciousness,
had paused a moment before going
inside to watch the battle. Therefore, he was still
on the palace steps when a squad of loyal troops
burst through the disloyal forces and ascended the
steps with a rush.</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer in command saw Jack standing there
almost alone, a revolver still in his hand, and pointing
toward the lad with his sword he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seize him!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Immediately rough hands were laid on Jack. In
vain he struggled to free himself and protested his
innocence of any wrong. The grasp of his captors
only tightened. In spite of his struggles he was
led down the steps and in among the heart of the
Russian troops.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here he was turned over to another squad of
men, with orders to take him at once before General
Burgoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later, together with a number of
Russian officers, the lad found himself before the
Russian commander. The latter looked them all
over carefully, then motioned to one of his men to
have Jack taken out.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He seems younger than the rest,” he said.
“Neither is he a Russian. I will take up his case
after I have disposed of the others.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack was taken from the general’s quarters, but
he had not long to wait. At the end of another
hour he was again led before the general. Besides
this officer and the man who commanded the squad
in charge of Jack, there was no one present.</p>

<p class='c004'>General Burgoff leaned back in his chair and
eyed Jack keenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is your name?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jack Templeton,” replied Jack in English.
“Lieutenant in the Royal British navy, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you doing here, then?” demanded the
general.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am here on a special mission by command of
the Czar,” replied the lad quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian commander smiled into his long
beard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A likely story,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is true, sir,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was the nature of this mission?” asked
the general skeptically.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My friend and I were sent here to expose Count
Blowinski,” returned Jack. “How well we succeeded
you may see by what has just happened.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the general smiled skeptically.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope you don’t expect me to believe any such
story as that?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do, sir, because it is the truth,” was the lad’s
response.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I don’t believe it. Of course, it is only
natural that you would have an excuse; all men do
when they are caught. It is my belief that you are
one of the traitors.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I assure you, sir——” began Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The general rose to his feet abruptly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Enough!” he said sternly. “Your lies will gain
you nothing. I shall prescribe the same punishment
for you as for the other traitors.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But if you would only investigate my claim, sir,”
protested Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A waste of time,” replied the general. “The
Czar must not be troubled with such matters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are likely to be troubled when the Czar
hears of this,” returned Jack quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” exclaimed General Burgoff. “You
dare to threaten me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am making no threats, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come, enough of this talking,” said the general.
“As I have said, your punishment shall be the same
as that of the other traitors.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Death?” asked Jack quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Worse,” was the general’s response.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack was surprised. What could be worse than
death, he asked himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The answer came in an instant and a chill struck
his heart, as General Burgoff said sternly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Siberia!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />INTO SIBERIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>If there is one country in the world where the
wheel of modern progress has failed to turn, that
country is Siberia. True, there is a railroad, or
perhaps several railroads, that traverse and extend
into the broad expanse of uninhabited country; but
they are few and far between. Except in times of
war, such as these, they are not much traveled.</p>

<p class='c004'>The road to Siberia, in Jack’s case, lay through
Petrograd itself. There, with perhaps fifty other
prisoners securely bound, he was thrown into an
open freight car, bound eastward.</p>

<p class='c004'>Muffled in his great coat, as he was, and with
his heavy fur cap pulled well down over his ears,
the lad was nevertheless very cold; still he was not
in such imminent danger of freezing as were some
of his fellow-prisoners, who, not garbed so warmly
when they were arrested, shivered terribly in the
frigid atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of his warm garments Jack’s teeth chattered.
Try as he would he could not stop them;
and when the train moved off, slowly at first, and
then faster and faster, it seemed that he could bear
it no longer. His hands and feet grew numb, he
felt his eyes closing and then he knew no more.
Unconsciousness had come to his relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Jack again opened his eyes it was because
he felt some one kicking the soles of his feet. He
tried to move them, but the effort was vain. He
could barely feel the shock of the other’s blows,
but he realized that he was expected to get up and
he knew that it would be best to obey, if possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly the blood began to circulate through his
legs and feet. They pained him sharply at first,
but gradually the pain subsided and at last the lad,
his hands still bound, struggled to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>He took in his situation at a glance. The train
had come to a stop, and Jack let his eyes rove to
the north, to the east and to the south and west.
Ahead was another freight car and behind another;
but from the sides all the lad could see was a broad
expanse of snow, stretching far into the distance.
There was not a sign of a human habitation, although
the lad knew that ahead probably was a railroad
station, or a shed that marked a junction, or
something.</p>

<p class='c004'>Russian guards, big heavily bearded men, forced
their way through the struggling heaps of humanity
in the car, stirring the half-frozen men with the
toes of their heavy boots. Some kicks brought
groans, others curses; but, in spite of this, the men
at last managed to get slowly to their feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack gazed at them curiously, forgetting for a
moment his own desperate plight. The majority
were men of middle age. Some were older and
some few younger.</p>

<p class='c004'>A groan at his feet attracted Jack’s attention.
There he saw a young boy—he could not have
been more than fifteen—lying upon the floor of the
car. The lad was small and delicate, half frozen,
and it appeared that he could not drag himself
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the big guard who stood over him paid no
attention to the lad’s pleadings to be let alone.
Twice he stirred the prostrate form with the toe
of his boot as Jack looked on; then, drawing back
his foot, he kicked the boy heavily in the side.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad gave a subdued cry and rolled away.
The guard moved after him and would have repeated
the kick, had Jack not taken a sudden step
forward, and in spite of the cords that bound his
hands, placed himself before the burly guard and
his victim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shame on you!” cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack spoke in English. Evidently the Russian,
while not understanding the lad’s words, guessed
their import. For a brief moment he hesitated;
then, drawing back his huge fist, he struck Jack
a heavy blow on the right cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack staggered, but did not fall. He stood his
ground, still facing the big Russian, but there was
a dark scowl on the lad’s face. Again the Russian
stepped forward and raised a hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>But before the blow could fall, Jack stooped a
trifle, and thrusting his head in front of him,
charged. The Russian was unable to leap back in
time to avoid Jack, and the lad’s head struck him
squarely in the pit of the stomach. The guard
doubled up and fell to the bottom of the car,
gasping for air.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a murmur of approval from the other
prisoners in the car; but this was soon silenced, for
half a dozen other guards, wielding revolver butts
and long whips, sprang in among them, and laid
about lustily. The prisoners could not fight, for
their hands were bound, and there was nothing for
them to do but to stand and receive the blows
stolidly. But there was anger in their eyes and
Jack knew that it would go hard with one of the
guards should a prisoner get a hold upon him.</p>

<p class='c004'>For himself, he bore up bravely under the biting
lashes of the whip that curled about his face and
legs, leaving great red welts. Eight, nine, ten
times, a whip wrapped around him; then, apparently
thinking the lad had had enough, the guard who
had attacked him desisted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack, braced for still another blow, staggered
forward as the man drew back, and evidently
believing that the lad was about to attack him, the
Russian quickly drew a revolver, reversed the butt
and struck Jack over the head. It was a hard blow
and the lad fell forward on his face. Once, twice,
he tried to regain his feet. Then a wall of blackness
descended upon him again and he knew nothing
more, while the Russian turned his attention to the
other prisoners.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Jack returned to consciousness the first
thing to call itself to his attention was the warmth.
His last remembrance was of cold. He tried to
think, but for the space of several moments he
could not piece together the tangled chain of events
that revolved and revolved in his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length, however, as he took additional note of
the pleasing warmth and realized that his feet were
no longer numb; that his ears were not frozen and
that he could breathe without the sensation of
snuffing ice. He was able, piece by piece, to recall
what had transpired.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove!” he said at last. “By rights, I should
be lying in an open car and freezing while some
great brute of a Russian stood over me with a
whip. Wonder where on earth I am?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He raised himself on one elbow and looked
around, but he could see nothing. The place in
which he found himself was pitch dark. The lad
thought he could now catch the sound of other
voices, and he called out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anybody here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad spoke in English and there was no reply.
He asked the same question again, this time in
French, and still there was no answer. A third
time he tried it, this time speaking in German.
He drew an answer at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; Boris Duttsky. Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack introduced himself in German and in the
darkness, and then added;</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are we?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Siberia,” was the brief response.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know that,” said Jack. “But where are we
right now? And what makes it so awfully dark in
here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are in a dungeon,” was the reply. “I
recognize a dungeon by the feeling, because I have
been in a dungeon before. I believe I know who
you are. You are the English prisoner, are you
not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought so. I spotted you in the freight car
when you knocked the guard down. That’s why
you’re here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And are we the only two in this place?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess so. I have heard no other voices.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you say I am here because I knocked the
guard down?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; they consider you a bad customer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And why are you here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For the same reason. I followed your example
in the car and butted a guard under the chin.
I wish I hadn’t now. It’s a bad business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why? All they have done is lock us up where
it is dark.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait; in the morning they’ll take us out and
give us the lash.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The lash?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; probably lay a dozen strokes across our
bare backs with their big whips. After that they’ll
give us bread to eat and water to drink; and that’s
probably all we’ll get for a week.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack shuddered. Then he straightened himself
up in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They had better not lay a whip on me,” he
said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why? What will you do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll fight. I’ll rush the man who strikes me,
whether I’m bound or not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That would be foolish. The punishment would
only be redoubled. No; take my advice, and grin
and bear it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know but what you’re right,” said Jack
after some consideration. “I’ll take your advice,
then, in part. I’ll bear it, but I won’t promise to
grin.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now that’s the way I like to hear a man talk,”
declared the Russian. “You are a man after my
own heart. It will hurt, of course, but it won’t kill.
Although,” he added as an afterthought, “I don’t
know but it would be well to kill a man at once,
rather than to kill him by inches as they do here
in Siberia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You talk as though you knew something about
it,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do. I had a brother who was once imprisoned
in Siberia, through a mistake. He was later released
by the personal order of the Czar; but in the
time he was here he endured much. He has told
me many tales of the cruelties of the guards and
their officers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, all we can do is hope that we shall have
a chance to escape,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No chance of that—without outside help,” declared
the Russian. “Besides, if you were able to
get away, where would you go? You are miles
from a railroad and you would perish of cold or of
hunger before you got far.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The railroad can’t be so very far,” Jack protested.
“It was only a few hours ago that we were
in a freight car.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A few hours,” ejaculated the Russian. “It has
been all of twenty-four.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Twenty-four,” exclaimed Jack. “Do you mean
I have been unconscious all that time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must have been. And it was a blessing that
you were. You saved yourself a hard walk through
the snow. You were carried on a sleigh while the
rest of us were forced to walk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then there is no escape?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A man escaped once,” returned the Russian
grimly. “There was no pursuit, for there was no
place he could go without food, as he had gone.
He was found a month later in the snow. There
wasn’t much left of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack shuddered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not for me,” he said aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” continued the Russian, “there is no chance
of escape; and for that reason the prisoners are
not even bound. No, without outside help, no man
ever escapes from Siberia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then,” said Jack quietly, “we must have outside
help.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />PRISON FRIENDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The conversation languished now; and a few moments
later the deep breathing of the Russian proclaimed
that he was asleep. But there was no
more sleep for Jack; he had slept until he could
sleep no more. For long hours he lay there in his
corner thinking.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been in some queer and peculiar places,” he
told himself, “but this is the limit; also, as this
Russian says, it’s not going to be an easy job to
get out of here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In the darkness of the dungeon it was impossible
to tell whether it was day or night outside. Jack
had lost all track of time. He felt in his pockets.
He had no matches and his watch and what money
he had had were gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ve cleaned me out pretty well,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several hours later Jack heard the Russian stirring
about again and came to the conclusion that
the man was awake. He hailed him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I’m awake,” came the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you have any idea whether it is day or
night?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t be daylight yet,” was the reply. “They’ll
have us out of here as soon as it is light.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I wish it would hurry and come then,”
said Jack. “I would like to get out of here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So would I; but I’d rather lie here peacefully
than to face what we must face when we get out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The lash,” replied the Russian calmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Jack shuddered. The word had an ugly
sound.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed only a short time later when a hand
was heard fumbling at the lock of the door to the
dungeon. Jack and the Russian got to their feet,
and then the lad realized that not even his feet
were bound. He walked up and down in the darkness
several times, with hands outstretched that he
might not bump into a wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now a streak of light pierced the darkness and
Jack made out a door at the far end of the
dungeon. There came a hoarse hail, and although
the words were unintelligible to Jack, he supposed
that they were a summons to come out. He approached
the door, the Russian behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside the door Jack and the Russian were surrounded
by a squad of soldiers, fur clad. Then they
were marched into the open. Here, for the first
time, Jack discovered that his great coat was missing.
He had not noticed the fact before, but the
extreme cold now called it forcibly to his attention.
He shivered.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of the cold, however, Jack glanced
around eagerly as he was led along. On several
sides were large rock structures. Men went in and
men came out. All were heavily clad and were,
apparently, soldiers.</p>

<p class='c004'>A short distance farther on, however, they came
upon a group of figures who were not soldiers.
These were prisoners, and they were not clad so
warmly as were their captors. Most of them
shivered and quaked with the cold. Jack, fresh
from the warmth of the dungeon, eyed them pitifully.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old men and young, girls and women there were
in abundance; and upon each countenance was the
same expression—that of fright. They were plainly
subdued and cowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Straight toward this group Jack and the Russian
were marched by their guards. There they
were halted and herded into line like a lot of sheep,
while their captors drew an armed circle about
them. Directly there approached a man taller and
more handsomely garbed than the others. This
man Jack took to be the commander of the outpost.
It transpired that he was right, for the big
man was General Surgoff, commander of this particular
prison camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>The big officer eyed the prisoners closely; then he
signaled one of his soldiers. In response to the
signal, the man hurried away, to return a few moments
later with two other stalwart fellows, each
armed with great black whips.</p>

<p class='c004'>The general motioned to a man foremost among
the group.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the guards thrust the man forward. He
approached the general, plainly cowed. The officer
spoke a few words to him; then turned to the men
with the whips.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ten lashes!” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c004'>The words were hardly out of his mouth when
the first lash fell upon the man’s shoulders. He
uttered a moan of pain, but he did not cry out.
Again and again the lash fell; until the ten blows
had been delivered. Then the prisoner stumbled
back to his place.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack grew sick at the sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next man summoned before the general was
the Russian who had occupied the dungeon with
Jack. The man went forward quietly and with an
air that impressed the lad with its courageousness.
Again there were a few short words and the officer
ordered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ten lashes!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian made no move as the first whip
descended across his shoulders. He took the next
blow unflinchingly and the others that followed, and
returned to his place without a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>All this time Jack had been standing within a
few feet of the place where the whipping had taken
place. He had stuck to the spot, for he knew it
would be unwise to show any sign of weakness or
fear.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next to face the general was a woman.
Perhaps her age was thirty, perhaps fifty. From
her face, so care-worn and haggard, it was impossible
to tell. A few words the general held with
her, too, then turned to the men who wielded the
whips.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Five lashes!” he ordered quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman uttered a piteous cry and fell on her
knees, raising an appealing hand to the general.
She was in this position when the first blow fell.</p>

<p class='c004'>The arm of the second man was now raised and
descended; but before the lash could find its mark,
Jack sprang suddenly forward and caught the blow
upon his left arm. With a cry of rage he leaped
upon the man who had wielded the whip and
snatched it from his hand with a single movement;
then he leaped back and struck the man squarely
across the face.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man staggered back.</p>

<p class='c004'>The second whip-wielder rushed upon the lad,
with his weapon raised. This blow, too, Jack caught
upon his arm. Before it could be repeated, he had
dealt the Russian a heavy blow across the face,
and, following it up quickly, snatched the whip
from the man’s hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, still furious, the lad wheeled upon the officer,
who had stood by, smiling the while. As
Jack faced him, the officer, still with a smile on his
face, drew a revolver and pointed it squarely at
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>So great was his anger, however, that Jack either
failed to see the revolver pointed directly at him,
or else he was too enraged to heed it. Ignoring
the weapon as though it had been no more than a
toy pistol, he leaped forward with a cry.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a flash and a sharp report and Jack
felt something burn the left side of his head; but the
bullet did not stay him. Before the officer could
fire again, the lad was upon him, the whip in his
right hand held high above his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Swish!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It descended with all the power of Jack’s good
right arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>The blow caught the general about the shoulders
and he staggered back, at the same time seeking
to bring his revolver again into use.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Jack was too quick for him. Again the
heavy lash rose and fell and yet again. Three
times General Surgoff attempted to raise his revolver
and fire and each time he was unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c004'>As each blow fell the general cried aloud in pain
and fear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly, tiring of his attempts to get a shot
at the lad, he turned and fled.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack, with a grim smile on his face, ran after
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Swish!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the lash wrapped itself around the officer’s
shoulders and he gave a cry of pain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Swish!”</p>

<p class='c004'>This time the lash caught him in the back of the
head and entwined itself about his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another howl from General Surgoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>Raising an arm in an attempt to shield his face,
the general lost his balance and fell to the ground.
Leaning over him, Jack seized him with his left arm
and jerked him to his feet. Then, thrusting him
off at arm’s length, he again brought the lash into
play.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eight!” he counted aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nine!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ten!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He threw the lash suddenly to the ground and
turned to face the squad of soldiers who came
running up.</p>

<p class='c004'>These men had been afraid to fire for fear of
wounding their commander; but now they laid rude
hands on Jack and held him, as General Surgoff
arose slowly to his feet and felt his face and
shoulders tenderly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer turned an angry glare on Jack and he
said very quietly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should have you killed. But I won’t. It
would be too easy a death. You shall have twenty
lashes every morning and nothing but bread to eat
and water to drink for thirty days. Strip him,
men!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack’s coat was quickly stripped from his
shoulders. His vest was jerked away and his shirt
ripped off. Then, his back bare, he was pushed into
the center of the crowd of soldiers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The general now summoned the two men who had
first held the whips and they seized their weapons
eagerly, for each had felt the weight of Jack’s
anger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Twenty lashes!” cried the general. “Ten from
each of you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack braced himself to receive the first blow. It
came a moment later with a terrible whishing sound.
The lash wrapped itself around his bare shoulders
and the pain of it was terrible.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Jack made no outcry.</p>

<p class='c004'>The second man delivered a hard blow, which
also caught the lad about the bare shoulders, only
from the other side. The lad staggered a trifle,
but kept his feet with a visible effort.</p>

<p class='c004'>A third and fourth blow came in rapid succession;
and Jack staggered first to the right and then to
the left. It was almost more than flesh and blood
could stand.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rawhides continued to fly with renewed
vigor. Jack, who had at first kept track of the
strokes, had lost all count now. He was doing his
best to remain on his feet; and he kept his lips
shut firmly to keep from uttering a cry of pain.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the fifteenth blow Jack was all but unconscious,
but he was still on his feet. At the
seventeenth he reeled and all but fell. At the nineteenth
he stumbled, and with eyes closed, fell face
forward on the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not feel the twentieth blow, for consciousness
had left him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men who had plied the lashes, stepped back,
tired out with their exertions. But they eyed Jack
with a certain degree of respect.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the terrible ordeal, not a sound had escaped
his lips.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />FRANK STARTS TO THE RESCUE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>After Count Blowinski’s attempt on the life of
the Czar had failed, it was several hours before
Frank and Lord Hastings found themselves in the
presence of the Russian Emperor. They had kept
out of sight immediately after the Czar’s arrival
in Moscow, for all feared that should the count
chance to see the lad, it would spoil everything.
Therefore, when they were summoned to the Czar’s
presence, it was to find Count Blowinski there as
well, though disarmed, nursing a wound in his
shoulder and guarded by a squad of troops.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have summoned you, my lord,” said the Czar,
“so that your officer here, Mr. Chadwick may confront
the count, and thus prove to him the uselessness
of further denials.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He signaled to Frank and the boy stepped forward.
Approaching close to Count Blowinski,
Frank gazed at him quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you anything more to say, Count?” asked
the Czar, with a cold smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing,” was the sullen response, “except this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Before any one could realize what he was up to,
the count leaped forward, and, throwing his left
arm around Frank’s neck, struck him heavily in the
face three times.</p>

<p class='c004'>In vain the lad struggled to release the grasp.
The count’s hold was like a grip of iron.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian troopers sprang forward at a word
from their officer and laid hold of the count, who
struggled viciously and clung to Frank’s neck
tenaciously.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the grip of the soldiers told at last and the
count was dragged away, muttering fierce imprecations
to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You see, my dear Count,” said the Czar softly,
“it is no use. You have played right into my hands;
and now that you have played, you must pay the
piper.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I assure your Majesty——” began the count,
straightening himself up and maintaining an air
of ruffled dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tut, tut, Count!” protested the Czar, with a
wave of his hand. “Why deny what is so plainly
apparent. You are guilty and I know it. Why,
I have had proof for days. I just laid this little
trap to catch you as you were about to strike. But,
my dear Count, I assure you that after this, your
claws will not be sharp enough to scratch. What
do you say, Count, shall it be death or Siberia?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You do not leave me much choice,” replied the
count, having regained his composure and facing
the ruler calmly. “Let it be death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In that event,” said the Czar, “it shall be
Siberia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your Majesty——” again began the count.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar silenced him with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take him away,” he commanded the officer in
charge of the squad.</p>

<p class='c004'>Struggling and kicking frantically, Count Blowinski
was dragged from the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” said the Czar to Lord Hastings, “I can
breathe easier. His very presence had polluted the
air. Come. We shall return to my suite.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He arose and the others followed him from the
room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alone with the Czar, and Lord Hastings, Frank
was moved to ask:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what do you suppose has become of Jack,
sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove! I don’t know,” said Lord Hastings.
“He should have turned up by this time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, he hasn’t, sir,” replied Frank quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Suppose you take a run over to your rooms
and have a look for him,” instructed Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank disappeared, but returned a few moments
later announcing that he could find no trace of his
chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strange!” said the Czar. “But wait. Perhaps
he was wounded in the fighting. I shall summon
General Burgoff. By this time he will have a
list of the injured. He may know something of
him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar immediately despatched an orderly for
the general, but it was half an hour later before
the officer arrived. In that time Frank’s uneasiness
had increased to a certainty that his chum was
in danger of some kind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“General,” said the Czar, when the officer stood
before him, “I am seeking information of a young
Englishman, who was in the city when I arrived.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“An Englishman?” repeated the general. “There
may be many here, Sire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So there may,” the Czar agreed, “but only one
like the one I am seeking. He has been living with
the Count Blowinski for some days. I had thought
that he would be with the count. In fact, I saw
him just before the trouble occurred. He stood
near the count on the palace steps.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh,” said the general, “was he big and young?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said the Czar, “he was big and young.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you say, Sire, that he was in league with
Count Blowinski?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I didn’t say so,” returned the Czar, “but
if you know anything of the Englishman, tell me
at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure he was in league with Count Blowinski,”
said the general. “If the Englishman is the
one to whom I refer, he is now on his way to
Siberia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar came to his feet with a jump.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?” he demanded, thinking he had
not heard aright.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I say he is on the way to Siberia, Sire,” replied
the general.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And why is he on the way to Siberia, may I
ask?” demanded the Czar, his voice very calm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because I ordered him sent there, Sire. I found
him on the palace steps flourishing a big revolver,
and I had my men seize him. He offered me some
strange story for his presence there; but I knew
he was lying. I had him transported to Siberia
along with a hundred other prisoners at once.”
“Oh, you did,” said the Czar. “By any chance,
did this Englishman tell you that he was engaged
on a mission for me, General?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He did, Sire. But, of course, I didn’t believe
any such story as that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not, General; as you say. But did
you think of taking the trouble to investigate his
story?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not, your Majesty. I knew you did
not wish me to take up your valuable time that
way. Have I done anything wrong, Sire?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing,” said the Czar, “except to send to
Siberia a British naval officer, a youth, who, by
risking his own life, has saved your country and
your Czar.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now it was the general’s turn to be astonished.
He stepped back in alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean he was telling the truth, Sire?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general clasped and unclasped his hands
nervously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And,” the Czar continued, “unless he is back
here within twenty-four hours, you shall be relieved
of your command, General.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar spoke very softly, but the general could
see that he was in deadly earnest, and his face
grew pale.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I fear it is impossible, sire,” he said at last.
“I have instructed the officer in command of the
prisoners, to let no one approach them for any
reason whatsoever. Even a telegram would not
catch them now, sire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, General, you are in a difficult situation,”
said the Czar quietly. “And yet I will give you
another chance. I shall relieve you of your command
temporarily and you shall go after this young
Englishman yourself. Bring him back to me safely.
Here,” and the Czar turned and scribbled a few
words on a piece of paper, after which he affixed
his seal, “this order, for the moment, appoints you
commander-in-chief of all the forces in Siberia.
Bring this young Englishman back to me safely, or
suffer the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general took the paper the Czar extended
to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It shall be done, sire,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And,” the Czar continued, “you will make careful
inquiry. If the young Englishman has been
ill treated, you will seek out the man who is the
cause of this ill treatment, arrest him and bring him
to me, be he who he may. Yes, even if it be General
Surgoff himself!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the general bowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your Majesty,” said Frank at this juncture.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar eyed him in surprise and Lord Hastings
disapprovingly. But Frank was not abashed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your Majesty,” he said again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?” said the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can I not go with the general, sire?” he asked.
“I would like to go to Jack’s aid as fast as possible.
He will expect me. He would hunt me out,
no matter where I was.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar looked at Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think, my lord?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As you please, your Majesty,” he replied. “I
have no doubt Mr. Templeton would be glad to see
him. Neither have I any doubt that Mr. Chadwick
here might come in handy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar turned to General Burgoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think, general?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, sire, to tell the truth, I would rather not
be bothered with excess.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In that case, general,” said the Czar, with the
suspicion of a twinkle in his eye, “and as you have
been somewhat lax in your own duties, I shall allow
the lad to accompany you. You will see that he is
well treated.”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Burgoff bowed low.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It shall be done, sire,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well. Now, general, you will take with
you from Petrograd enough men to assure you that
your orders will be obeyed, come what may. Do
I make myself clear?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly, your Majesty. I shall take sufficient
men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And one thing more, general,” said the Czar
firmly. “Let me impress upon you the utter necessity
of being in the right hereafter, before you take
too much upon yourself. Men have been shot for
less.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general accepted this rebuke with a bow and
a flush of the face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall obey, sire,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. Now, make what haste you may. That
is all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general saluted stiffly, motioned to Frank to
follow him, turned on his heel and stalked from the
Czar’s presence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank stopped a brief moment for a word of
farewell to Lord Hastings and then expressed his
thanks to the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There, there!” said the latter with a laugh.
“No thanks are necessary. I am glad to give you
a chance of seeing Siberia with an opportunity of
coming back. Run along now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank hurried after General Burgoff. And as
he moved quickly along he muttered to himself:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poor old Jack! All alone away up there in
Siberia. I’ll bet he is having a terrible time and
looking for me. Well, I’ll be there before long,
Jack, old boy!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br />CRUELTY BECOMES UNBEARABLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“That’s enough. I’ll save the extra lashes until
he is in a condition to feel them. Take him back
to his dungeon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was General Surgoff who spoke. He looked
down upon the prostrate form of Jack, who, shirt
again stripped from his shoulders, had fallen beneath
the terrible blows of the lash in his second
whipping.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was at the tenth blow that Jack had fallen
forward on his face, unable to bear the pain any
longer. General Surgoff decided that it was
useless to waste blows on an unconscious enemy, so
he had called upon his men to hold their hands.
However, he had no intention of letting Jack off,
and in his memory he made a note of the fact that
there were additional blows coming to the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men dropped their whips. One took
Jack by the head and the other by the feet and
they carried him back to his dungeon. There they
left him, after first thrusting a pan of water and a
small piece of bread into the cell.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack was brought back to himself by something
cool upon his head. He stirred a bit and when
at last he was able to sit up he became aware that
his head was supported on a man’s knee, while his
temple was being bathed with cold water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you feel now?” demanded a voice,
which Jack immediately recognized as that of the
big Russian who had been with him on the first day
he had been confined to the dungeon.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty weak,” said Jack feebly. “I don’t think
I can undergo another such ordeal.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A man never knows how much he can stand
until put to the test,” said the Russian, with a
shrug of his shoulders that was imperceptible to
Jack in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how do you come to be back in here?” demanded
Jack. “You were not here last night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Boris. “But this morning, just after
you had been so severely punished, I could keep
quiet no longer and expressed myself to General
Surgoff.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With what result?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the Russian shrugged, but Jack failed to
see the gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The lash,” he replied quietly. “Fifteen lashes;
then the dungeon again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack now got to his feet, though with some difficulty,
and leaned on the Russian’s arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s no use,” he said, after pacing up and down
the dark cell for some moments. “A person is a
fool to stay here and put up with this sort of
thing. Better death in the snow. To-morrow,
when I am again led forth for my lashing, I shall
make a break for liberty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is impossible,” said Boris. “You would be
shot down before you had gone a dozen yards.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s where you are wrong,” said Jack. “To
General Surgoff, I am too valuable to be killed offhand.
He would keep me alive until he is tired
of seeing me suffer. After that, perhaps, he would
order me shot; but until then no. If I can get anything
like a start, perhaps I can reach one of the
sleighs that always stand nearby. Then I can make
a dash for liberty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the Czar!” exclaimed Boris; “and perhaps
after all you can reach the sleigh safely. I have
a mind to go with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are the more likely to be shot down,” said
Jack. “The general, I fear, would have no scruples
in ordering your death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nevertheless,” said Boris grimly, “with your
permission I shall try it. Besides, if we do get
away, two would be more handy than one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True,” said Jack. “Now if we only had
weapons.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There may be a rifle or two left in the sleigh,”
said Boris hopefully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There may be,” said Jack, “but we can’t bank
on that. There may not be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then we shall have to go without weapons,”
said Boris finally.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack was deep in thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m still weak from my beatings,” he said at
last, “but, if I am fortunate, I shall secure weapons
for both of us. Not rifles, perhaps, but revolvers
at least.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How?” demanded Boris excitedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack smiled to himself in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know exactly,” he replied quietly,
“though I have half an idea. Now we shall have
to map out our plan of action.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll let you do that,” said Boris. “I am not
much of a hand to figure; but when it comes to a
fight you can count on me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You look as though you could give a good
account of yourself,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the darkness he stretched forth his hand and
felt Boris over carefully. The muscles swelled
beneath the lad’s touch and Jack knew that the
Russian was indeed a powerful man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m no weakling,” said the Russian modestly,
“but for the matter of that neither are you. I have
taken note of your build and I have thought to
myself that, between us, we would be a hard pair
to overcome.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris now extended a hand and felt the lad’s
arms and chest carefully. When he withdrew his
hand he gave a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll do,” he said quietly. “Now as to your
plan.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack, “I have a half-formed plan.
It will depend upon you to some extent what our
chances of success are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can count on me to the finish,” said the
Russian gravely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. Then what we shall do is this. When
I am led forward to receive my lashing, you create
a diversion of some kind. Give a yell or something,
but make no dash toward the row of sleighs
at that moment. It would prove fatal, for you
would be shot down. However, make enough
noise to attract attention your way. At that moment
I’ll jump the general and seize his revolvers—he
most likely will be caught off his guard. Then
I’ll dash for the sleighs; and as soon as you see I
have the general’s weapons, you do the same.
Whoever reaches there first will take the reins and be
ready to whip up the horses the moment the other
jumps in. That’s all there is to the plan.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s not half bad,” said the Russian, “and it
promises a certain degree of success. So you are
going to steal the general’s revolvers, eh? I like
that. And if he interferes with you, shoot him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not if I can help it,” said Jack. “I intend to
come back here some day and attend to him with
my hands.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, but he is too big for you there,” protested
Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you believe it,” said Jack dryly. “Take
his guns away from him and give me fair play, and
I’ll promise I’ll whip him good and properly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps,” said the Russian, but he was plainly
unconvinced. “But were I to make a wager, I
would be forced to put my money on the general.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope there will be no occasion for you to lose
your money,” said Jack, smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the way,” said the Russian after a pause,
“how are your injuries? I can’t see in the darkness,
but I have no doubt the lash has left its
mark.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It has indeed,” said Jack in reply. “My
shoulders are bruised and bleeding. There are several
welts across my face, and my legs and arms
are very painful. But they feel better, now that
I know I shall not stand still and receive more
blows of the same kind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you have put your mark on the general,
anyhow,” said Boris, his tone greatly pleased.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So I have; but I have paid dearly for it,” responded
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Boris who finally put an end to the conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take my advice,” he said, “and get what rest
you can to-day and to-night. To-morrow is near
and there is no telling when you will sleep again.
It is always well when a man has rested before he
undertakes a desperate venture. He is in better
condition.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your advice is good; I shall heed it,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>He lay down again in his corner and soon was
asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>All day and all that night the two prisoners rested
in the dungeon as well as they were able. It was
impossible to sleep all the time, but they did no
walking about; and when morning came they felt
well and fit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each gulped down the water and bread that was
thrust through the bars to them early in the morning;
and each was on edge when the guard unlocked
the heavy door and called upon them to emerge
from their prison.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris stepped out as lively as a kitten, but Jack,
to whom the work ahead seemed to be more serious,
walked quietly, with head bent. Apparently taking
the lad’s attitude for one of fear, the Russian
guard sneered audibly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris caught the sound and looked up sharply.
He opened his mouth to make a remark to the
guard, but Jack, perceiving that Boris was about
to cause trouble, raised a warning finger. Boris’
mouth closed without saying a word, although Jack
could see that he choked back the words at the
tip of his tongue with an effort.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad smiled to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll be a pretty good partner,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c004'>They followed the guard until they again stood
in the presence of General Surgoff. The latter eyed
them evilly as they approached, and motioned for
Jack to step forward. The lad did so unhesitatingly.
Boris would have followed, but the guards
shoved him back among the crowd of other prisoners.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack looked quickly around as he stepped toward
the Russian general. Some distance away, perhaps
two hundred yards, he made out several sleighs, all
ready to be put in use.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If there were only one,” he muttered; and he
determined in that moment to try and frighten
the other horses as he leaped into one sled.</p>

<p class='c004'>He faced the Russian commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And how do you feel this morning?” asked the
general.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not very well, thank you, sir,” returned Jack
quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Feel like another little whipping will do you
good, eh? Well, you shall have it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I just want to remark to you, general,” said
Jack quietly, “that you will rue the day you first
laid the lash on me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What! You threaten me?” exclaimed General
Surgoff. “You shall have an additional ten lashes
this morning, whether you stand on your feet or
fall fainting to the ground. Strip him, men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The pair of Russians with their lashes stepped
forward and would have laid hands on Jack; but
Boris now decided that it was time for him to act.</p>

<p class='c004'>He set up a sudden wild yell, that drew all eyes
in his direction. It was the moment for which
Jack has been waiting.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />ACROSS THE SNOW.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>General Surgoff’s head was turned toward
where Boris and several Russian guards were
struggling when Jack sprang upon his back like a
cat. The general sent out a cry for help, but Jack
cut it short as his hands closed about his opponent’s
throat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Still retaining his grasp with his left hand, Jack’s
right dropped to the officer’s belt. A revolver was
quickly drawn and the lad stuffed it into his pocket.
Then he seized the second revolver, shoved the
Russian officer violently from him and dashed
toward the sleighs.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a cry from behind and several rifles
were brought to bear, but, even as Jack had expected,
General Surgoff cried at the top of his
voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take him alive! Death to the man who injures
him!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack shouted aloud as he continued to run toward
the row of sleighs. Turning his head, he looked
over his shoulder and saw that Boris too had eluded
the men with whom he had been struggling and
was running after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come on, Boris!” he cried, but Boris needed no
urging and his feet seemed to fly over the ground.
For a man of his size his speed was nothing short
of remarkable.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack reached the row of sleighs well in advance
of Boris. Of these conveyances there were four
in all. Jack slapped the horses attached to three of
the sleighs sharply and they dashed off. The fourth
would have followed, but Jack leaped in, seized the
reins and checked the animals. Then he waited
calmly for Boris, who came rapidly toward him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack still held one of General Surgoff’s revolvers
in his right hand, his left being sufficient to hold
tight the reins. The lad saw one of the Russian
guards stop in his tracks, throw his rifle to his
shoulder and take aim at Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gripping the reins tighter with his left hand,
the lad raised his revolver and fired quickly. The
man who was aiming at Boris fell to the ground.
Panting loudly, Boris now reached the sleigh and
jumped in. Immediately Jack fired his revolver
over his horses’ heads and shook the reins over
their backs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Giddap!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is extremely doubtful if the animals understood
Jack, but the reins slapping on their backs and
the nearness of the revolver shot did the work. The
animals dashed off with a jump.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now from behind came the command Jack had
been expecting. General Surgoff, seeing his victims
about to make their escape from beneath his very
eyes, shouted:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shoot!”</p>

<p class='c004'>A volley of rifle bullets flew overhead and all
about them. But none struck home and the horses
continued their mad dash. A second and a third
volley came with no better result.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fools!” muttered Jack. “Why don’t they
shoot one of the horses.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Apparently the guards had not thought of that,
for no bullet came near the flying animals.
Stooping low in the sleigh, Jack and Boris heard the
whine of the bullets as they sped past. Several
struck the back of the sleigh and were imbedded in
the wooden seat.</p>

<p class='c004'>But at last the flying horses drew the two fugitives
out of range, whereupon Jack immediately
checked their pace.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No use wasting horseflesh unnecessarily,” he
said to Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not a bit,” was the rejoinder. “Say, that was
a bit of quick work, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was,” agreed Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what did you shoot at me for?” demanded
the Russian.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shoot at you?” exclaimed Jack in surprise. “I
didn’t shoot at you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, you pointed your revolver right at me.”
“Oh, no I didn’t,” said Jack. “I was shooting
over your head. One of the guards had drawn a
bead on you with his rifle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did you get him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did; else you wouldn’t be here now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” said the big Russian. “I hope I am
able to repay the debt some day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was nothing,” declared Jack. “Now, if we
only knew where we were going, it would be all
right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no place to go, so far as I know,” said
Boris. “All you wanted to do when you started,
if you will remember, was to get away where there
would be no more lashings. We are away now, so
what more can you ask?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean that we will just wander around until
we die of cold or starvation?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we won’t,” said Jack. “We’ll go along
with some definite object in view. Now, which way
would you take the railroad to be?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris swung an arm in a southerly direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Off there—some place,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good; then we’ll head that way,” and Jack
swung the horses in the direction indicated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But there is no chance of reaching the railroad,”
protested Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is always a chance,” said Jack calmly.
“Always a fighting chance so long as one has breath
in his body. It is better to be moving toward a
definite objective than to lie idle and wait for
death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I guess you are right there,” said Boris.
“But after we reach the railroad—if we do reach
it—then what? If we are picked up we will probably
be sent right back where we came from.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We won’t cross that bridge until we come to
it,” returned Jack quietly. “Our first consideration
is to reach the railroad.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we could be so fortunate as to strike a road,”
said Boris, “we might have a chance; but to go
driving through the snow like this, blindly, we have
no hope of getting there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you suppose these horses have been over
the road often enough to pick it out themselves?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know; you might try them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack gave the animals their head. Immediately
they slowed down, and then the off horse began
to pull toward the right. After some resistance
the other followed him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s going some place,” said Jack hopefully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And we are going along,” replied Boris with a
grim attempt at humor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half a mile ahead, having pulled the sleigh over
steep piles of drifted snow, the horses again headed
southward. The going was much easier. The
ground ahead now showed signs of recent travel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove! They have picked the trail,” declared
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So they have,” said Boris. “Do you know, I
am beginning to have hopes that we shall reach
the railroad.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course we shall,” said Jack confidently. “It
may be hard work, but we shall reach there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And then?” demanded Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Jack shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who knows?” he muttered and gave his undivided
attention to the road that stretched out
ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>All day they drove slowly along, for they did
not wish to tire the horses more than was necessary.
It was bitterly cold, but the two travelers
had been fortunate enough to find heavy rugs in
the sleigh, and these kept them quite comfortable.
Also Jack had come upon one pair of gloves. These
had to do for both, so the one kept his ungloved
hands beneath the robes while the other did the
driving.</p>

<p class='c004'>It grew dusk.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack, glancing back down the road, saw a moving
object coming after them. It looked like a dog
and the lad called Boris’ attention to the form loping
along behind them, apparently content to remain
at the same relative distance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris took one look at the following form and
cried out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“A wolf!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wolf!” cried Jack. “I thought it was a dog.
Oh, well, no matter. We can certainly take care
of a lone wolf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So we can,” said Boris dryly. “The trouble
is that by an hour after dark it won’t be a lone
wolf. There will be wolves by the score upon our
track.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But can’t we outrun them?” asked Jack fearfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We might, if our horses were fresh. But you
must remember we have traveled all day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then we shall have to fight,” declared Jack
quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course,” said Boris briefly. “But with our
hands we can do little.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack produced Surgoff’s revolvers and passed
one of them to Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>“These will help a little,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A little, but not much,” said Boris with a shake
of his head. “A few wolves shot down and there
will still be more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He glanced over his shoulder again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look!” he exclaimed. “There is another!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack looked back and his heart beat more fast as
he saw that the first loping gray figure had been
joined by a second and that they came forward
rapidly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There will be more of them directly,” said
Boris calmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we have wasted time enough,” declared
Jack at this point. “Before the pack assembles, I
believe it would be well for us to whip up and put
as much distance between us and the wolves as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We won’t be able to put much,” said Boris pessimistically.
“The faster we go the faster they will
go, until the pack has closed in, and then they will
come to the attack.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can you shoot?” asked Jack suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Like a flash,” was the reply. “I can hit anything
that can be hit. Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you do the shooting and I’ll do the driving,”
said Jack. “Here, you take both these guns.
Give me the reins and the whip.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The exchange was made, and Jack touched the
backs of the horses lightly with the whip.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we were only near to a human habitation of
some kind,” he muttered to Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we may and we may not be,” was the
reply. “But these fellows will follow us right to
the edge of the city. It’s been a hard winter and
they are hungry. Hear them howl?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a blood-curdling sound that Jack heard
then. It sent a shiver down his spine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the call of the pack,” said Boris briefly.
“They’ll be down on us in a moment. See, in the
darkness back there now there are fully a score.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For answer Jack got up to his feet and the long
whip whistled through the air and over the horses’
necks. But the animals, too, had caught the scent
of the wolves, and they needed no urging. They
dashed forward. And at that moment Boris, glancing
back, shouted:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here they come!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />THE BATTLE WITH THE WOLVES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The pack came forward with a rush. Great,
long, gaunt figures, they covered the ground with
remarkable speed. Each bound brought them closer
to the swift-flying sleigh in spite of the best efforts
the tired horses could put forth; and they were
putting forth their best, for they were in even
greater fear than the human load they bore.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the first wolf reached the back of the sleigh
and launched itself in a desperate leap. His forefeet
found their mark, but he had not gauged the
distance accurately and he slipped back; but he tried
again. The second time the leap was more true
and he clung to the back of the sleigh and attempted
to pull himself up.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was that moment that Boris fired. The ball
sped true and the first wolf went tumbling back into
the road.</p>

<p class='c004'>Immediately the others of the pack set upon him
and tore him to pieces with their sharp teeth; then
they dashed forward again.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the second attack seemed to have been
carefully thought out. While several of the larger
wolves leaped for the back of the sleigh, others of
the pack darted by the sleigh on either side and
sprang upon the horses. Jack turned his whip
from the backs of the horses and lashed out at the
wolves. Some he hit and some he missed; but he
swung the long whip with great violence and for
the moment the attack was beaten off. In the rear,
Boris had also been successful a second time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus they gained a breathing space and Boris
called out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have only two shots left!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then it looks as though we were done for,”
said Jack quietly, as he continued to ply the whip
and the horses sped on.</p>

<p class='c004'>A hundred yards ahead, the road turned sharply
and the panic-stricken horses dashed madly around
it. The wolf-pack was now some distance back, for
they had stopped over another fallen comrade.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Jack let out a cry of joy. Not a hundred
yards ahead was a small building of some kind—in
the darkness the lad could not make out just
what—but it was a refuge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quickly he imparted the good news to Boris and
cried:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Drop off and run for the door as we go by.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad threw the reins upon the horses’ backs
and climbed to the back of the sleigh, as did Boris.
Then, just as the sleigh went flying past the low
building, they dropped to the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both went sprawling, but they were up quickly
and dashing toward the door of the little hut, as
it now appeared to be. From behind, the wolf-pack,
seeing their prey so near, leaped forward
with renewed energy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Open the door quick!” shouted Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris laid hold of the knob, turned it and pushed
vigorously. The door opened and Boris stepped
back to let Jack pass in first. The lad hesitated a
brief moment and then sprang inside. Boris would
have followed, but at that moment three gray figures
launched themselves through the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris’ revolver spoke twice—his two last cartridges
were now gone—and two of the enemy fell
to the ground; but the leap of the third wolf—the
largest of the pack—carried him to Boris’ shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian was borne to the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was up in a minute with a terrible cry, and
seizing the wolf in both his great hands, he plucked
him from him; then, turning, he threw the animal
squarely into the pack as it dashed upon him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pack gave back and Boris took advantage of
that moment to spring within the hut and slam
shut the door; even as the wolves, recovering,
leaped against it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Inside the two fugitives hurriedly barred the
door and sank to the floor, tired out from their
exertions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Safe!” panted Jack at last, getting to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess so,” returned Boris. “They can’t get in
here unless there is a window open. Look around
quickly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They explored the hut in the semi-darkness—a
faint light reflected from the snow without permitting
them to see. Examining the window
through which the light came Jack found it covered
by glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess they won’t try that way,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You never can tell,” replied Boris with a shake
of his head. “If they are really desperate and
hungry, they may try to spring through. The first
would break the glass and the others would have no
trouble getting in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it’s the only window in the place; we
should be able to guard it,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked about the floor and at last picked up
a big log that lay before the old fireplace. It was
heavy, but the lad wielded it without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We should be able to hold them off with this,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian looked at the weapon and nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the Czar!” he exclaimed. “I had no idea
you could handle that weight so easily.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As I told you before, I am no weakling,” replied
Jack quietly. “We shall take turns at the
door. I suppose the pack will draw off with the
coming of day?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It depends,” said Boris, “upon how close we
happen to be to other human beings. If we are
close to the railroad, where men pass frequently,
the pack will probably draw off at daylight. If
not, we shall have to stand a siege.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At that moment there was a sound of crashing
glass and both looked toward the window just in
time to see a huge grey shape come flying through
and alight upon its feet on the floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack raised his log and would have brought it
down on the animal’s head, but Boris cried:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guard the window! I’ll take care of this one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack leaped to obey and arrived just in time to
bring the log crashing down on another head as
it showed itself. While Boris struggled with the
wolf inside, the lad disposed of four of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris and the wolf that had succeeded in gaining
an entrance sprang toward each other at the
same moment. Both were wounded already, Boris
with a bite in the shoulder from the animal he had
encountered before entering the hut, and the wolf
from a cut inflicted by the ragged pieces of glass
as he passed through the window.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris presented his side as the wolf dodged and
stepped slightly aside. The animal’s teeth nipped
the Russian’s clothes, but failed to reach the flesh.
Before the beast could recover, Boris had seized
him by the throat with both hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>A mighty grip, this, and the wolf struggled in
vain, scratching and wriggling as it was lifted clear
off the floor. Holding him at arm’s length, Boris
continued to shut off the beast’s wind. The wolf
gurgled once, twice and then became limp in Boris’
hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Boris was wary. He had no mind to allow
himself to be tricked, knowing well that a
wolf, sometimes when cornered, resorted to all
sorts of subterfuges. Boris held his grip for several
minutes; then flung the wolf’s body from him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess that settles you,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He approached the window to lend Jack a helping
hand if necessary; but the enemy, having lost
four of their number there, hung back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think they will try it again for a while,”
said Jack calmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can’t tell,” returned Boris. “Sometimes
they never give up. Now you keep guard here and
I’ll see if I can’t start a fire. We would be safer
then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack nodded and Boris turned away. A few moments
later Jack heard him give a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Find anything?” the lad called.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Plenty to start a fire,” was the response. “Wood,
husks and matches. I’ll have a fire going in this
fireplace in a few moments. Then we shall be
safe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The big Russian was as good as his word, and
a few minutes later a cheerful blaze filled the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” said the Russian, “I wonder if I couldn’t
scare up a little food?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He rummaged about in the drawers of a table
at the far end of the room and presently returned
to the fireplace carrying a piece of cold meat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t know what it is, but it will do,” was his
comment. “I’m too hungry to be very particular.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So am I,” Jack agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian produced a long knife from one of
the drawers and cut the piece of meat in two,
handing half to Jack. They devoured it ravenously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not so bad,” said Jack, smacking his lips when
the last piece had disappeared down his throat.
“Tastes funny, though. What do you suppose it
was?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Horse,” was the brief reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack gulped and swallowed several times before
he could force himself to reply:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wha—what’s that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Horse,” repeated Boris. “Didn’t you ever eat
horse before?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“N-n-no, I guess not,” replied Jack, feeling somewhat
sick at his stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s good,” said Boris. “Next to a piece of
beef, give me a good piece of horseflesh. Why,”
noting the queer expression on Jack’s face, “you
don’t mean to tell me you don’t like it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t say that I am fond of it,” replied the
lad truthfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But——” began Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack jumped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Please don’t talk about it any more,” he said
with a sickly smile. “If I have eaten a piece of
horse, all right. But I don’t want to be told about
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ho! ho!” laughed Boris. “Now what do you
think of that! Here is a brave young man turning
sick just because he has swallowed a piece of horse.
Ho! ho!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed long and loudly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t you please keep quiet?” asked Jack, getting
sicker every minute. “Horse! Ugh!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Realizing that the lad really and truly didn’t like
such talk, the Russian desisted. He arose and
walked to the window. Without, but some distance
from the hut now that the fire was blazing freely
in the open place, stood the gaunt, gray wolves.
Boris called Jack to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll stay there as long as this fire is kept
burning,” he explained. “But there is no need for
both of us to stand guard. One can watch and
keep the fire going and the other can sleep. We’ll
divide the night into four-hour watches. You lie
down on the pallet there in the corner. I’ll stand
the first watch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack did as Boris suggested and was soon asleep;
and all through the long night, inside the hut one
stood guard as the other slept—and the break of
day did not come any too suddenly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />CAPTURED BY NEW ENEMIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Dawn came early in Boris’ second watch. The
wolves still maintained their vigil without. The
Russian kept the fire blazing brightly. He determined
to let Jack sleep an hour longer.</p>

<p class='c004'>But this was not to be.</p>

<p class='c004'>Glancing from the window, Boris saw the wolves
suddenly begin to move away. It was strange and
the Russian was unable to account for it. But he
was not long making out the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p class='c004'>Came the sound of footsteps without—not a
sound made by a single man, but rather by a large
body of men. Boris became instantly apprehensive,
and tip-toeing across the room, he aroused Jack
quietly. As the lad opened his eyes the Russian
laid a warning finger to his lips:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sh-h-sh,” he said softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter now?” demanded Jack.
“Wolves?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surgoff?” whispered Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t tell yet,” was the reply. “There are men
outside. Perhaps they will pass by without looking
in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No such luck, with those dead wolves out there,”
said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad was right. Suddenly there came a voice
from without, raised in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ho! There must be men within the hut—dead
or alive. See the dead wolves? There must have
been a battle. We shall go in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The footsteps approached the door. A moment
later there was a loud knock.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall we open the door?” whispered Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“May as well,” replied Boris. “If we don’t, they
will break the door in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Came a second heavy knock on the door and a
voice called:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is there any one there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“One moment and I shall unbar the door,” Boris
called back.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door opened at last, three men, cloaked in
the uniform of Russian officers, strode in. They
eyed Jack and Boris keenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you doing here?” demanded one, evidently
the commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We took shelter here from the wolves,” replied
Boris guardedly, for, if possible, he did not wish to
tell the officers they had recently come from the
direction of the Siberian prison camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where from?” asked the officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“From the north,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are your horses and sleigh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Boris shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably devoured by wolves by this time, your
excellency,” he returned. “When we leaped out
the horses were still running and the wolves after
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you from the prison camp?” demanded the
officer suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The question came so suddenly that, although
Boris had been expecting it, it caught him off his
guard. His face turned red as he stammered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why—why, n-no, your excellency.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That,” said the officer, who had not been fooled,
“is an untruth. When did you escape?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yesterday,” replied Boris in a dull voice, for
it was evident to him that it was only a question
of time until he would be back in the dungeon.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because we were cruelly treated, your excellency,”
said Jack, stepping forward and taking a
hand in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely you don’t expect ladylike treatment here
in Siberia?” suggested the officer with a grin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hardly, sir,” returned Jack. “But this is no
treatment for a British officer, and when his Majesty
learns of it, you may make sure that the Czar
will take some drastic action, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oho! so you know the Czar, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian smiled sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I know the Czar,” returned Jack quietly;
“and if you are wise, you will be careful of your
actions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad’s statement seemed, for some reason, to
impress the officer. He dropped his tone of banter
and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we shall see about your case. I shall conduct
you back to General Surgoff myself. First,
however, I have other business. I am sent to meet
General Burgoff, who is coming to Siberia on some
mysterious mission. We will move toward the
railroad. In the meantime, you are both my prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer signaled them to leave the hut, which
they did. Outside they found a large body of men
in sleighs, in one of which there was room for two
more men. The officer motioned Jack and Boris
in, and after instructing his men to see that they
were carefully guarded, the party drove off.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was shortly after noon that they came in sight
of the railroad, and Jack made out the same station
where the train had stopped when he had entered
his first fight in Siberia. The party rode up
to the station and alighted. All entered the station,
where the officer approached the operator.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Special train will be here in half an hour, sir,”
replied the operator in reply to the officer’s question.
“You are in good time, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well,” said the officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat down to wait.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was less than half an hour later that a distant
rumble gave notice that the train was approaching.
A few moments later it drew up at the station. The
Russian officer uttered an exclamation of astonishment
as troops began to pour from the twenty
cars.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the Czar!” he exclaimed. “I wonder why
General Burgoff comes in such force? I had
expected that he would come practically alone. Here
he must have five thousand men!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless he advanced to meet the Russian
commander without delay.</p>

<p class='c004'>General Burgoff descended from his car with a
firm step and haughty mien. He did not pay much
attention to the officer who came forward to greet
him, other than to return his salute and say a few
words. He spoke to one of his own officers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have the men on the march immediately,” he
said sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter saluted and moved away.</p>

<p class='c004'>The general entered the station and by his side
walked Frank, come to Siberia to find his friend
and chum. And no sooner had Frank entered the
station that his eyes rested upon Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jack!” he cried and dashed forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack turned quickly in utter amazement at the
sound of his chum’s voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Frank!” he cried joyfully, and half rose, only
to be pushed down again by one of the soldiers who
guarded him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank turned upon the soldier and cried:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let him alone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this moment the Russian officer who had captured
Jack and Boris came up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here,” he said to Frank. “These men are
my prisoners and neither you nor any one else can
interfere with them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that so?” shouted Frank, losing his temper.
“Well, I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c004'>A firm hand was laid on the lad’s arm and he
looked into the face of General Burgoff; the general’s
face wore a peculiar smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Silence, if you please,” said the general. “I
shall attend to this matter myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank drew back a trifle as General Burgoff
turned toward the officer who accosted Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You, sir,” said the general sternly, “are hereby
relieved of the custody of your prisoners. I shall
accept the responsibility; and in the future when
you address any one at all, let it be in more of a
gentlemanly manner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer flushed at this rebuke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But sir,” he protested, “I must make my report
to General Surgoff, sir. He is in command in
Siberia and he will not like your having taken my
prisoners from me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now don’t let that worry you, colonel. You
need report to General Surgoff no more except
when I tell you to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The colonel bowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not know your authority, sir,” he said,
“but I must yield to you as my superior officer.
The prisoners are yours, sir; but I would add, if
you will permit me, that they have escaped from
General Surgoff and that he would probably be
glad of their return.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well,” said the general. “I am going to
pay my respects to General Surgoff. You may
consider yourself on my staff for the present. Now
present my compliments to Colonel Luskowith and
tell him to march immediately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The colonel bowed and departed. General Burgoff
advanced to Jack’s side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So!” he exclaimed, “the young Englishman
whom I sentenced to Siberia, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The same,” said Jack briefly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have come,” continued the general, “to tell
you that I have discovered my grievous error, to
release you and to ask your pardon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack was on his feet instantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say no more about it, sir,” he exclaimed.
“You were greatly worried and overwrought at
the time, sir. Any man will make a mistake, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general looked at the lad keenly and then
extended his hand. Jack grasped it. Then the
general turned to Boris.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And your fellow prisoner?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Boris,” said Jack. “He has aided me greatly
in making my escape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, for that reason, if for no other,” said
General Burgoff, “I shall not question the reason
of his imprisonment. He is free.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general motioned the soldiers who guarded
the two to stand aside.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now,” he added, “tell me how you have
been treated. Have you any complaint to make?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack’s lips set sternly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do not think I am whining, sir,” he said, “when
I say that the treatment accorded prisoners by
General Surgoff and his underlings is barbarous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell me,” said the general.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack told of his own treatment and that of other
prisoners as he had witnessed it. General Burgoff’s
face turned red as the lad progressed, and when
he had concluded, he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I shall pay my respects to General Surgoff,
and at the Czar’s command. So that is the way
prisoners are treated in Siberia, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“General,” said Jack, “I have a favor to ask.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Name it; it is granted,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, sir, in respect to General Surgoff, will
you not follow my plan?” and the lad outlined an
idea that had come into his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Jack stopped talking, General Burgoff
clapped his hands and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good! Good! It shall be done! Come, gentlemen,
we shall move at once. I shall indeed be
glad to see my dear General Surgoff!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />A SEVERE REPRIMAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>General Surgoff had word of General Burgoff’s
approach long before the long line of troops
appeared in sight. The former immediately made
preparations to receive him.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was an hour after the first troops came within
view of the prison camp that General Burgoff and
General Surgoff saluted each other. Then the latter
extended his hand, but General Burgoff appeared
not to see it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Said the Siberian commander:</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you will come to my quarters, sir, I shall be
pleased to make you at home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, sir,” was the reply, “but first I would
deliver to you two prisoners whom I have picked
up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He summoned his orderly. The latter went away
and returned a few moments later with Jack and
Boris, surrounded by a file of soldiers. At sight
of them, General Surgoff’s eyes lighted up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah!” he exclaimed. “They escaped from here
very recently, General Burgoff. I am indeed glad
to have them back again, especially the young one.
I shall teach him a lesson that he shall not forget
if he lives to be a hundred; and with your permission,
sir, I shall do it now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall be glad to see the form of punishment
you use in Siberia,” was the other’s reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Immediately the Siberian commander summoned
two men, who it appeared were his official “lashers.”
They came forward with their long whips,
and cruel smiles on their features. General Surgoff
indicated Jack with a gesture of his right arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strip him and give him thirty hard lashes!” he
ordered.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men sprang forward and laid hands on the
lad, who submitted without a murmur. General
Surgoff eyed him with an evil smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So!” he exclaimed. “I have you back, eh?
Well, before I am through with you, you will wish
you had died in the snow. Hurry, men!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men now stepped back and raised their
whips. But before the first blow could be struck,
General Burgoff sprang forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stop!” he commanded in a harsh voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>Somewhat bewildered the men dropped their
whips.</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff turned upon General Burgoff
angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean, sir?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean that things like this shall come to an
end,” declared the other. “There will be no more
of this brutality in Siberia, when it is in my power
to stop it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In your power, sir?” questioned General Surgoff.
“You forget, sir, I am in command here.
The punishment shall proceed. Apply the lash,
men!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“One moment,” said General Burgoff quietly,
raising a hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the men dropped the whips they had raised.
General Burgoff turned to the Siberian commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have allowed this matter to proceed thus far,”
he said, “because I desired to see how you conducted
matters here. I have seen enough. And besides
having seen, I have heard. Your sword, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff staggered back in utmost amazement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wha—what’s that?” he demanded, hardly believing
the senses of his own ears.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your sword, and at once,” said General Burgoff.
“You may consider yourself under arrest,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A slow smile flitted over the other’s face, now
that he was sure he had understood.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You forget, sir,” he replied, “that I am in
command here. I, sir, in turn, demand your sword
for having interfered with your superior officer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Burgoff laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely,” he said, “you don’t think I would make
such a demand without some assurance that I could
enforce my orders. Come, sir, your sword, and
quickly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And by whose command do you act?” asked
General Surgoff, somewhat uneasily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At the command of the Czar!”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff again staggered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—but——” he began.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Silence,” interrupted General Burgoff. He drew
a piece of paper from his pocket and passed it to
the other. “By this,” he said, “I am empowered
to relieve you of your command in Siberia and
I have full authority to act in your place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff read the paper and his eyes
flashed dangerously. Suddenly he tore the paper
into little bits and turned upon the other defiantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is your authority,” he said, and threw
the fragments of paper to the wind. “You are
powerless to touch me now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again General Burgoff smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are a fool,” he said pleasantly. “Why do
you think I came here at the head of five thousand
men? Either you will give me your sword this
moment as a sign that you recognize my authority,
or I shall put you and your entire command under
arrest, if I have to shoot half of them down to
do so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But sir,” protested the other, “surely you will
not humiliate me in the sight of my men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You cannot be humiliated, sir,” was the reply.
“You are too low for that. It gives me pleasure,
sir, to tell you that you are a coward and a cur.”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff’s hand dropped to his sword
belt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No man can call me that,” he said, “and live.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I do,” declared his successor. “I call you
that and I shall live to see you brought before the
Czar. Now sir, for the last time, your sword.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly General Surgoff drew his sword and
seemed on the point of passing it to the officer who
had relieved him of his command. But suddenly
he raised it before him and sprang forward with
a cry.</p>

<p class='c004'>General Burgoff was taken completely off his
guard. Not so Jack. He had been eyeing Surgoff
closely and had half expected some such move.
Therefore, at the moment the man leaped forward,
so did Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>With his right hand the lad struck the officer’s
arm and then closed with him. With a sudden
movement he seized the arm that held the sword
and he twisted it sharply. The sword went flying
through the air and struck ten yards away, while
the Russian sought in vain to free himself from
the lad’s clutch.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length, believing he had the man powerless,
Jack released his hold and stepped back.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a sudden movement the infuriated officer
whipped out a revolver and aiming it directly at
the lad, pressed the trigger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack had seen the movement, but he was so surprised
that he seemed to be rooted to the spot. He
was unable to move.</p>

<p class='c004'>But there had been another close witness of the
struggle and the quick action of this watcher alone
saved Jack’s life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank had sprung suddenly forward and succeeded
in knocking up the Russian’s arm at the
very moment his finger tightened on the trigger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack therefore emerged from the cloud of smoke
unharmed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Frank had grappled with the officer and
was seeking to wrest the revolver from his hand.
But the lad was no match for the big Russian. Jack
sprang forward just in time to lend a helping hand
and General Surgoff was subdued without much
trouble.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” said General Burgoff to the deposed
officer, “I shall have the pleasure of informing the
Czar that you attempted to assassinate me. Do
you realize what that will mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff made no reply, though he glared
at the other angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the way, General,” said Jack, stepping forward
at that moment, “you haven’t forgotten the
promise you made me, have you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Burgoff smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No danger,” he returned. “I shall be an interested
witness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned again to General Surgoff. “Surgoff,”
he said, “did you ever hear of men fighting with
their fists?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” was the answer, in a snarling voice. “I
have had some such experience myself. I took boxing
lessons under an English instructor. Why do
you ask?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because,” was the reply, “this young British
officer here,” and he indicated Jack with a motion
of his head, “tells me that he has a score to settle
with you and that he would be glad to settle it
by the use of his fists. If you are proficient in
that art of fighting, so much the better. You may
possibly save yourself a severe thrashing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you mean that you are going to consent to
such a thing?” demanded the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am; most decidedly. Even now I can see the
marks of the lash on this lad’s face. Certainly he
is entitled to payment; and I intend to see that he
gets it. If you refuse to fight, I shall have you
lashed myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff eyed Jack keenly. The lad,
though not as tall and broad as the officer, still
was husky enough to give the general an idea that
he would not be easily conquered. Besides, through
long residence in Great Britain in his younger days,
the officer had come to hold a great respect for the
Englishman when it came to the use of fists. Still,
compared with himself, Jack seemed small. Surgoff
became possessed of the idea that he could
overcome him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll fight him,” he said in answer to General
Burgoff’s last remark. “But I want to tell him
now that he will be sorry he ever crossed my path.”
Jack smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because of the chance that I shall have at you
now,” he said, “I am glad that I encountered you.
You may believe me, for every lash of the whip
you have given me, you shall pay now. I will not
let you off too easily.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You boast,” said the other. “It is unwise. Before
I am through with you you will be crying
another tune.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps,” said Jack quietly. “Well, General,”
turning to General Burgoff, “whenever you say,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It may as well be now,” was the reply. “Are
you ready, Surgoff?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stripped off his outer garments and rolled up
his sleeves. Jack did likewise. Frank stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you please, sir?” he said. “I would like to
run this thing. I know more of boxing than you,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general nodded his permission.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Proceed,” he said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br />THE FIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Frank stepped forward and called both combatants
to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fight will start when I give the word,” he
said. “There will be no rounds. You will keep
fighting until one of you can fight no more. My
job shall be to see that you, Surgoff, do not resort
to unfair methods. I assure you that if you do,
I shall tap you over the head with my revolver.
Now you both understand, do you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Surgoff surlily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. Then go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Surgoff sprang forward with a cry, apparently
bent on disposing of his opponent with a single
blow. In spite of the fact that he knew well the
power of the Englishman when it came to fists,
he threw caution to the winds. It was perfectly
plain that he considered himself more than a match
for Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack avoided the rush by sidestepping neatly and
as the Russian was carried by by the force of his
rush, Jack planted a heavy blow solidly above the
right ear. The big Russian went reeling. Jack
leaped lightly forward and before his opponent
could recover himself, he had stepped around him
and drove a left to the jaw.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian covered as best he could and gave
ground. Jack followed him closely, and succeeded
in driving three blows under the other’s guard.
Then the Russian rushed into a clinch.</p>

<p class='c004'>He clung to the lad tenaciously and it was only
by a violent effort that Jack succeeded in hurling
him away. Surgoff went sprawling on the ground.
Jack stepped back and waited for his fallen foe to
rise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want to end this too quickly,” he said
between set teeth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Surgoff staggered to his feet and raised his
guard, waiting for the lad to come to him. Apparently
he had had enough of rushing tactics and
had determined to put up a defensive battle.
Nothing loath, Jack advanced, treading lightly on his
toes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad feinted sharply with his left for the head,
and drove his right fist squarely to the pit of the
Russian’s stomach. Surgoff doubled up like a jack-knife
and fell forward to the ground, where he
rolled and tumbled about for the space of several
minutes. Again Jack stood by quietly, waiting for
him to rise.</p>

<p class='c004'>No sooner was the man on his feet again that
Jack rushed forward. Again he feinted with his
left—this time for the stomach—and as the Russian
lowered his guard to ward off the blow, Jack’s
right fist caught him on the nose. Jack had drawn
first blood.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Jack stood off at long range and peppered
his opponent beautifully, much to the delight of the
large crowd of officers and men that had gathered
about, and was increasing at every moment, as
word of the encounter was passed along.</p>

<p class='c004'>In vain did the Russian try to ward off the sledge-hammer
blows. Jack was not to be denied; and
there was no pity in the lad’s heart, for he remembered
his own lashings and the lashings of others,
men, women and children. He had determined to
pay Surgoff in full.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Surgoff rushed into a clinch. Jack felt the
man’s hands close about his throat, and the Russian
had a powerful grip. But both of Jack’s hands
were free, and he loosened the other’s hold by driving
a straight right to the stomach. For a third
time the Russian general rolled on the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack smiled grimly as he waited for the man to
regain his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” he said, when Surgoff again faced him,
“we’ll count off twenty good blows and then call
it square.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Smack!”</p>

<p class='c004'>His right fist caught his opponent upon the sore
nose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Smack! Smack!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Right and left crashed against Surgoff’s jaws.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Smack!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Another to the sore nose.</p>

<p class='c004'>And so it continued, Jack counting the blows
aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sixteen,” he said quietly, as he drove an extra-vicious
left jolt to the man’s swollen right eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seventeen!” and he closed the right optic with
his right.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eighteen!” and Surgoff staggered weakly from
the effect of a blow to the nose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nineteen!” cried Jack, as he brought the man
forward with an extra-violent blow to the stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, the man absolutely at his mercy. Jack
dropped his right arm low and swung from the
shoulder. Straight and true went the blow and
caught Surgoff squarely upon the point of the
chin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Twenty!” said Jack quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned toward where Frank was standing;
and thus did not see Surgoff sink weakly to one
knee and then tumble to the ground face downward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’ve evened up my score,” said Jack to
General Burgoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you have done it handsomely,” was the
reply. “By the Czar! this fighting with fists must
be a great game. I had no idea a man could do a
foe such injury.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I suppose I could have done it a bit
quicker,” said Jack. “But I didn’t want to put him
out too suddenly. It would have been too merciful,
and I cannot see that a man like him is entitled to
mercy. Still, I flatter myself I did an artistic job.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You did,” agreed the general.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack now glanced toward his fallen foe, who was
returning to consciousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly Surgoff raised himself upon his elbow;
then struggled to his knees and at last to his feet.
Not a hand was extended to help him. Seeing Jack
standing some distance away, eyeing him, Surgoff
raised a fist and shook it at the lad as hard as his
feebleness would permit.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shall pay for this,” he exclaimed in a
hoarse voice. “You shall answer to me some day.
If I ever get you in my power, you will rue this
day’s work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack smiled scornfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall make it a point never to fall into your
power,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned his back upon the Russian.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now General Burgoff advanced and glared at
the vanquished Russian officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go to your quarters at once, sir!” he commanded.
“You are under arrest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Without a word, General Surgoff turned on his
heel and made his way slowly to his own quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you going to do with him, sir?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take him before the Czar,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why trouble His Majesty?” said Jack.
“Surely he has been punished enough. Why not let
him go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the Czar!” exclaimed General Burgoff
again. “So you are so forgiving, eh? Now, were
I in your place, I could wish nothing better than
to see him hanged.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want to see any man hanged, sir,” returned
Jack decidedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, that’s the difference between an Englishman
and a Russian,” said the general. “However,
you are the fellow who has suffered. I shall do
as you suggest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, sir, simply deprive him of his rank and
let him go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general threw wide his arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It shall be done,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He summoned his orderly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have General Surgoff brought back here,” he
commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>The orderly saluted and moved away. He was
back a few moments later followed by the deposed
commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what do you want with me now?” demanded
the latter somewhat aggressively.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I were you,” returned General Burgoff
quietly, “I would adopt another tone. That kind of
talk will do you no good and I am likely to change
my mind regarding what disposition I shall make
of you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Influenced by this Englishman, perhaps,” sneered
General Surgoff, with a malevolent look at Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hardly,” was the grim reply. “Surgoff, I have
decided that it is unnecessary to take you before
the Czar. I shall attend to your case myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean that I shall be put to death?” exclaimed
the other. “Certainly you dare not shoulder
such a responsibility.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I dare anything,” was the reply. “But such is
not my intention. No; I shall simply turn your
command over to your immediately subordinate and
allow you to go free, first commanding that you
leave Siberia immediately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment it seemed that General Surgoff
could not believe he had heard aright. Then he
stepped toward General Burgoff and said brokenly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thank you, sir. I shall go to the front and
seek to enlist in the ranks. Perhaps it is not too
late for me to serve Russia well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do,” replied General Burgoff in a more kindly
voice. “But do not thank me for this chance.
Thank this young Englishman here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff stared at Jack in the utmost
surprise. Plainly such cases of forgiveness were
beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I bear you no ill will,” said Jack quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I do you,” growled the deposed officer. “I
shall accept this chance, sir,” turning to the general
again, “but I will thank no one but you. And one
more word,” again turning to Jack, “if ever I am
fortunate enough to lay hands on you, I shall make
you pay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, all right, if that’s the way you feel about
it,” he said with a slight smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>General Surgoff saluted General Burgoff stiffly;
turned on his heel and marched away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You see,” said the latter to Jack. “You see what
forgiveness means to a man like Surgoff.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, well,” said Jack, “at least I have kept my
own conscience clear. That is something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>General Burgoff eyed the lad keenly for some
moments, considering this remark. At last he
turned away; and he also shrugged his shoulders;
and he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are right, my lad. That is something!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br />JACK IN THE TOILS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Petrograd again.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was evening five days after Frank and Jack
had returned to the Russian capital from Siberia.
Since their arrival they had made several trips of
inspection to the D-17, but upon their last visit this
same day they learned that it would be another
week before the submarine was ready to take to
sea again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads had passed the long five days in various
ways. They had received the thanks of the Czar
for the part they had played in exposing Count
Blowinski and His Majesty had commissioned them
honorary lieutenants in the Russian army.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of days they had strolled about the city taking
in the sights of interest; of nights they had taken
in the theaters—for there was still amusement to
be found in Petrograd—a few of the most popular
restaurants and other places where crowds congregated.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the two lads walked along the street this particular
evening they were discussing the D-17 and
the fact that they were soon to put to sea again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll be glad to get back in British waters again,”
said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So will I,” agreed Frank, “but there is no sign
that when we leave here we shall go straight
home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where else would we go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. But you must remember Lord
Hastings has begun to keep his plans more to
himself than he used to do. In fact, he told us so.
We are just as likely to head for the Dardanelles
or South Africa, for all we know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, that’s so, too,” said Jack. “However, I
have one of those things you call—that you call—By
Jove! I can’t think of the word. Premonitions,
I mean.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The word you want,” said Frank, “is hunch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s it,” cried Jack. “A hunch. I have a
hunch that it will not be long before we are back in
England.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I won’t object to that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will be glad,” said Jack, “when the time comes
when we can go ashore and stay—when the war
will be a thing of the past.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid that is a long ways off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It does seem so. And still when peace does
come, it probably will come suddenly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this point in the conversation Frank looked
at his watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seven o’clock,” he said, “and I am getting hungry.
Suppose we stop in the restaurant for supper.
Lord Hastings will not expect us back very early.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suits me,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank led the way and a few minutes later the
two lads were seated in a cozy corner of the restaurant,
gazing upon the crowd that thronged the
place.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This,” said Frank, “reminds me of a night in
Heligoland.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So it does,” said Jack, and added slyly: “Except
that there is a certain fair singer missing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had noticed that difference,” said Frank. “I
wonder what happened to her? I hope she did not
get into trouble.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think she is smart enough to look out for
herself,” said Jack. “Some of these days, when
the war is over, we may possibly encounter her
some place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish we would. We owe her a whole lot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So we do,” agreed Jack. “Now if she——”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad broke off suddenly and laid a hand on
his chum’s arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>For answer Jack pointed cautiously to a form at
the far end of the room. The man’s back was
turned and he had not seen the lads.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?” said Frank inquiringly, after glancing
at the man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Doesn’t he look familiar to you?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I can’t say that he does—not from the
back, at any rate. Whom do you think he is?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack, “I feel positive that he is none
other than our old friend Count Blowinski.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” exclaimed Frank incredulously. “But
Count Blowinski is in Siberia by this time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He should be, I’ll admit,” agreed Jack. “But
he can’t be in two places, and he’s here. Therefore,
he can’t be in Siberia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pshaw!” said Frank. “Now that you have
called my attention to the man I do see a certain
resemblance in build, but I don’t believe he is Count
Blowinski.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” said Jack. “But I do believe it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Their supper was now placed before them and
the lads fell to with a will, Jack the while casting
an occasional glance toward the man he believed to
be Count Blowinski.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack finished their meal before the
big man—whoever he was—and Frank was for
leaving immediately. But Jack protested.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe the fellow is not Count Blowinski,” he
said, “but it will do no harm to make sure. If I
could get a look at his face, I believe I would know
him whether he was disguised or not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, go over and accost him,” said Frank with
a smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not much,” returned Jack; “for if he did happen
to be the count there would be an uproar and
he might get away. No, we’ll wait here until he
goes out and then we’ll follow him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good night!” said Frank. “Here you are hunting
more trouble again. What would Lord Hastings
say?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know what he’d say. However, he is
not here, so we won’t worry about that. But if
you don’t want to come along, I can trail the fellow
by myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I’ll go along,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was probably twenty minutes later that the
man at the other end of the room rose, called for
his hat and coat and made his way from the restaurant.
Strain as they would, the lads were unable
to catch sight of his face; so they hurried after
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside, Jack recognized the figure half a block
down the street. He led the way in pursuit, Frank
a few paces behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the man, fearing he was followed, was trying
to shake off possible pursuers, he could not have
gone about it in a manner more to have aroused
Jack’s suspicions.</p>

<p class='c004'>First he crossed the street and then turned to the
left down a side street. At the next corner he
again turned to the left, walked two blocks ahead,
and again turned to the left.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whoever he is, he’s up to something with all
this maneuvering,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll bet I’m right,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the man ahead turned a corner, this time,
however, to the right. Jack and Frank came around
the corner a moment later and the former uttered
an exclamation of dismay. The man they had
been trailing was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now where do you suppose he has gone?” demanded
Jack in deep disgust.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not knowing, I can’t say,” said Frank. “But it
wouldn’t be much of a guess to say that he disappeared
in one of these houses. Which one, I haven’t
any idea.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose you’re right,” said Jack. “I wonder
if he suspected he was being followed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe so. I saw him turn once or
twice, but I am sure he did not suspect we were
trailing him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack moved on.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s a little alley,” he called back to Frank.
“Maybe he ducked in here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, take my advice and don’t go fooling
around there in the dark,” advised Frank. “It’s
darker than pitch there. A man in the alley could
see you, and if he were there, he’d crack your skull
before you even saw him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I’m not going to try it,” said Jack. “I was
just wondering; that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As long as you stay outside and wonder, it’s
all right, I guess,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>But events so shaped themselves that they were
not to stay out of the dark alley. Jack’s sharp
ears caught the sound of a body moving in the
alley.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is some one in there,” he called excitedly
to Frank. “I’m going after him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold on,” cried Frank. “Come back here,” he
added as Jack started forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was too late. Jack had already disappeared
in the darkness. Drawing his revolver,
Frank also sprang forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the darkness it was impossible to see a hand
before one, but Jack moved forward, revolver in
hand, without fear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who’s here?” he demanded, first in French and
then in German.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no reply, and the lad repeated the
question, continuing to walk further up the dark
alley.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then, before the lad could raise a hand to
prevent it, something the nature of which he could
not distinguish in the brief moment before he lapsed
into unconsciousness, struck him over the head.
Jack fell to the ground without so much as a
murmur.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was silence again in the alley, at last
broken by an exclamation from Frank, as he moved
slowly forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jack! Are you all right?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jack!” exclaimed Frank again. “Are you
there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again there was no reply and Frank became
greatly alarmed. Thinking only of his friend, and
forgetful of his own safety, the lad sprang forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the darkness he tripped over a prostrate form
at the same moment that a blow, the exact counterpart
of the one that had laid Jack low, struck him
upon the head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank also crumpled up without a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>From within the darkness of the alley there came
a hoarse chuckle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So!” exclaimed a voice that would have been
familiar to both lads could they have heard it.
“So! You thought to recapture Count Blowinski,
eh? You fools. You should have known I would
be on my guard. Now what am I going to do with
them? I would like to take them with me, but I
can’t lug them both. I have it. I’ll take one, leaving
the other here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The count stooped over the two forms which
lay within a few feet of each other and lifted Jack
in his arms. Then, paying no further heed to
Frank, he moved toward the street.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the mouth of the alley he hesitated for a
moment. He gazed up and down the street, but
saw no one. He moved on again, carrying his human
burden.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half a block from the dark alley, he mounted
a pair of steps and opened a door. He glanced back
over the street and saw a lone pedestrian hurrying
along. Whether the man had seen him with his
human burden, the count could not tell. He
shrugged his shoulders and closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’ve got one of them here,” he said to
himself. “The dog! Had it not been for him my
plot would not have failed. He shall pay!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The blow which had laid Frank low in the alley
had not been as severe as the one Jack had received
for the reason that when Frank tripped over his
friend’s body, the blow had glanced off his head
rather than crashing solidly upon it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore Count Blowinski, carrying Jack’s limp
body, had hardly passed from the alley when
Frank returned to consciousness. His first thought
was of Jack and he called to him. Receiving no
answer, and feeling certain that there was no longer
any enemy in the alley, Frank drew a match from
his pocket and struck it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flare showed the lad that except for himself
there was no human being there.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott! He must have carried Jack away!”
the lad exclaimed. “Jack would never have gone
without looking for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank got quickly to his feet and hurried from
the alley. Glancing in both directions, he saw a
man coming toward him. The lad hurried up and
accosted the man in French.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter shook his head, signifying that he
did not understand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank tried again, this time in German. The
man nodded. He could understand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you see anything of two men, a man and
a boy?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I saw one man,” was the reply. “He seemed to
be carrying another figure. Whether it was that of
a man or a boy I could not tell.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did he go?” demanded Frank eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Into that house there,” said the man pointing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank did not waste any further words. He
dashed forward, unheeding the cries of the Russian.
The latter stared at the hurrying lad for some moments
and then ran after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The boy is going to get himself in trouble,” said
the Russian. “I may be able to help him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At the foot of the steps Frank paused, for it had
struck him suddenly that it would be very foolish to
climb the steps and ring the bell, as he had first
thought of doing. As the lad hesitated, the Russian
joined him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you going to do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going in after my friend,” replied Frank.
“I was just trying to think of a way to get in without
Count Blowinski being aware of my presence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Count Blowinski!” exclaimed the Russian.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The man who would have betrayed the Czar?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian extended a hand to the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may count on my help,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good!” said Frank. “Now, we may as well try
this front door. Perhaps it will open.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it won’t, I’ll open it for you,” said the Russian.</p>

<p class='c004'>They ascended the steps and Frank laid a hand
on the knob and turned it cautiously. The door
was locked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me get there a minute,” said the Russian.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stepped in front of Frank. Taking something
from his pocket he inserted it in the keyhole.
Then he stepped back as the door swung open.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank led the way inside. The Russian followed
closely.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br />A FIGHT WITH A MADMAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When Jack came to himself he was sitting in a
chair in a well lighted room. For a moment the
blinding glare made it impossible for the lad to
make out his surroundings, but gradually his eyes
became accustomed to the light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before him, an evil smile on his face and a revolver
in his hand, stood a large man in an attitude
of leisurely nonchalance. Jack recognized Count
Blowinski instantly and made a move as though to
rise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sit still!” commanded the count harshly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack sank back in his chair. He said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the count, “so we meet again, eh,
Lieutenant Templeton? I believe that is the name,
isn’t it. Lieutenant Templeton.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is my name,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I don’t know whether it is or not. But
before I am through with you it won’t make much
difference what your name is—perhaps I should say,
was.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack made no reply to this threat and the count
continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It grieves me much that I cannot also have with
us your friend and fellow-spy. I would have brought
him along, but I couldn’t very well carry both of
you. So I chose you, because you are the largest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” said Jack dryly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, well,” said the count, “I’ll go back when
I have disposed of you. Maybe he will still be
there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In that event,” said Jack to himself, “it is up to
me to play for time.” Aloud he said: “Seems to
me one of us should satisfy you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So it would, under ordinary circumstances,”
said the count. “But these are extraordinary circumstances.
You both tricked me. Therefore you
shall both pay. If I cannot find your friend when
I return to hunt for him, I shall find him later.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is one thing that pleases me, at any rate,”
said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am glad to hear that,” returned the count.
“Would it be impolite for me to inquire what that
one thing may be?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not at all. The thing that pleases me is to know
that eventually you will suffer for your treachery.
The idea of a man of your kind selling out to the
enemy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s enough of that kind of talk,” said the
count angrily. “Another word like that, and I’ll
shoot you as you sit there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t see that the time will make any difference,”
said Jack quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither will it,” was the reply. “However, I
intend to use my own judgment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And may I ask how you intend to perform this
execution?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may,” was the reply. “I intend that you
shall sit in that chair. I shall move back a ways,
for I want to do a little practice. It will make no
difference if I do not kill you with the first shot; in
fact I had rather that I did not. A little suffering
won’t be too great payment for what you have
done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are a nice sort of a gentleman, aren’t you,”
said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s neither here nor there. Time was when
I was a gentleman. You have made it impossible
for me to continue so. That is why you must
die.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You were never a gentleman,” said Jack quietly.
“A gentleman is always a man of honor. You
could never have been a man of honor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think so, eh? Well what you think has
nothing to do with matters. Are you ready to
die?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Jack. “Are you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What has that to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A lot. I was just wondering if you would be
able to meet your death as calmly as I shall be able
to meet mine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So! a boaster, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I am no boaster,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you, anyhow? An Englishman?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. How did you guess it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have seen many of your kind. I thought
so. Well, there will soon be one Englishman less
in this world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So you say,” said Jack. “To tell the truth, I’m
not sure you have courage enough to shoot a man,
when he is looking at you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shall see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course, I know it would be easy enough for
you to shoot a man in the back,” said Jack. “That’s
about your size.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian was becoming furiously angry. His
face turned a deep red.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shall see,” he said again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, why don’t you shoot?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>In his heart he had no doubt that the Russian
would shoot. But the lad believed that if he could
get the man angry enough, he could throw him off
his guard for a second. Once the revolver wavered,
Jack had decided to spring upon the count,
come what might.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the count moved back another step. He
raised his revolver carefully. Jack’s heart sank,
for there was no sign of nervousness in the man’s
manner. The lad was about to hurl himself forward
anyhow, when there came an interruption
from an unexpected source.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door to the room suddenly burst in. Jack
gave a cry of glad surprise as he saw Frank’s face
framed in the doorway. As his chum dashed
through the door, Jack fell suddenly to the floor;
and it was well that he did so, for a second later
Count Blowinski’s finger pressed the trigger of his
revolver.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bullet whizzed through the air right where
Jack’s head had been a moment before.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the count had no time to fire again, for Frank
and the Russian were upon him. Neither was
armed and they dashed in close before the count
could aim and fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank seized the count’s revolver arm and thrust
it upward. The Russian dashed in and grasped
the hand that extended high in the air with the
revolver. A first twist failed to dispossess the count
of his weapon, but a second sharp twist had a better
result. The revolver went hurling through the air,
crashed through a window pane and fell to the
street.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Count Blowinski, a powerful man, turned
to give battle with his bare hands. With a sudden
cry of rage, he hurled the two from him, and,
stooping, seized a chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>As his Russian opponent sprang in, the count
raised the chair high in the air and brought it down
on the man’s head.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a thud as the improvised weapon
struck him, and the Russian rolled on the floor.
The count had successfully disposed of one of his
foes. He sprang toward Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>The count had dropped the pieces of the chair
after striking the Russian, apparently feeling able
to account for Frank with his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>But there was one thing he seemed to have forgotten.
That was Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The count had not had time to watch the result
of the shot when he fired at the lad and believed his
bullet had gone home. When he sprang toward
Frank, it was with the belief that he had a single
adversary to contend with.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore, he was unprepared for the attack that
Jack launched from behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack, having picked himself up from the floor,
had been circling around seeking a good chance
at the count. He had been on the eve of jumping
in when the count had seized the chair with which
he disposed of the Russian, but had dropped back,
unable to prevent the fall of the blow. He still
felt the effects of the blow he had received in the
alley, but his head was clearing fast and he was
gaining strength rapidly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, seeing the count advance upon Frank, Jack
sprang forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>His left hand grasped the collar of the count’s
coat, and checked him in his rush. As the count
turned upon his new adversary, he encountered
Jack’s fist, which struck him squarely in the face
with terrific force. The count staggered and at
the same moment Jack struck again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The second blow also went true.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the count recovered himself with an effort,
and lowering his head, charged directly at Jack.
The latter would have stepped nimbly out of the
way and avoided the rush had it not been for the
prostrate form of the Russian over which he tripped
now. Count Blowinski threw his arms about Jack
and hugged him in a tight embrace.</p>

<p class='c004'>The breath was all but squeezed from Jack’s
body and it seemed that his ribs must crack. Had
the count been able to retain the pressure another
moment, Jack must have collapsed. Fortunately,
however, the count’s breath also gave out and he
was forced to release his hold.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack sprang back gasping for breath, even as
Frank leaped upon the count from behind and
clasped his fingers in his throat.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a fierce roar of rage, the count wheeled
upon Frank, broke loose the lad’s hold, and before
Jack could come to his chum’s assistance, had hurled
the lad clear across the room. Frank’s head struck
the edge of a table with a terrible force and he
dropped to the floor unconscious. Thus had the
count been able to dispose of a second of his foes.</p>

<p class='c004'>He now turned just in time to meet Jack’s rush.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Jack had decided by this time that it was
foolish to close with the count, who was possessed
of tremendous strength. The lad had laid his plans
carefully as he was momentarily recovering from
the count’s last embrace. He had determined to
hold his opponent off at arm’s length, if possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a time, it seemed that Jack would succeed.
As the count came forward, Jack crouched, and
sent a hard right hand blow to the count’s nose.
Apparently the count didn’t think much of this
style of fighting, for he rushed forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>This time Jack was able to sidestep nimbly and
he floored the count with a well-directed right blow
just above the ear as he passed. He sprang forward
to take advantage of this opening, but the
count suddenly reached out and grabbed the lad
by the legs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack tumbled over on top of his foe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now both combatants threw their arms about
one another and struggled for supremacy. Jack
was still on top and he was determined to stay
there if it were humanly possible. The count was
struggling as strenuously to get from beneath
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Jack felt a finger press his cheek,
missing his eye by a scant inch. Immediately Jack,
by a great effort, freed himself of the other’s hold,
and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Trying to gouge, eh?” muttered the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was exactly what the count had tried to do.
He had been seeking Jack’s eye with his finger, and
he had all but found his mark.</p>

<p class='c004'>Count Blowinski also got to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>One rush he made at Jack. This, too, the lad
escaped by a quick side leap, and again his fist
crashed to the side of his opponent’s head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more the count turned and rushed and
again Jack adopted the same tactics. The count
staggered from the effect of the blow he received
as he passed, then righted himself and seemed about
to charge again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack made ready to receive him.</p>

<p class='c004'>But, so suddenly that Jack could make no move
to stop him, the count turned in his tracks, leaped
to the door, pulled it open and disappeared into the
hall.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a startled cry Jack leaped after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>But when the lad reached the outside door and
gazed up and down the street there was no sign of
Count Blowinski.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now I wonder where he could have gone to,”
said the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>He gazed both ways for several minutes. Then,
with a shrug of his shoulders, he turned and re-entered
the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s gone,” said Jack. “Now I’ll see what I
can do for Frank.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He ascended the stairs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <br />COUNT BLOWINSKI IS CAPTURED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“And so the count has escaped, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Czar Nicholas who spoke as he gazed at
Jack and Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, your Majesty,” replied the lad, and for a
second time, at the Czar’s request, he went over
the details of the struggle with the count.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the Czar when the lad had concluded,
“there is no telling in what part of the city
he may be located now. Still, I would like to catch
him. I wonder how he escaped from Siberia? or
if he was ever taken?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably the latter was the case,” declared Lord
Hastings. “The count has been a powerful man
and must have made friends. It is probable that
the officer who had charge of him became temporarily
blind, purposely.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I were sure——” said the Czar, and he
banged his fist on the table angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first thing,” said Lord Hastings, “if I may
make so bold, your Majesty, is to recapture Count
Blowinski before he can do any more damage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No small job,” said the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps not,” agreed Lord Hastings. “Still it
can be done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What would you suggest. My Lord?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My plan is a very simple one,” said Lord Hastings,
“and yet it means lots of work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s have it,” said the Czar eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Scour the city,” said Lord Hastings. “Put
every available man to work and search the town,
every nook and corner of it. Eventually you are
bound to catch him. He must be in the city still
and it will be only a question of time until some
of your men come upon him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a big job,” said the Czar meditatively.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the sooner it is started the sooner the count
will be taken,” said Lord Hastings dryly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“True,” returned the Czar briefly. “If you will
leave me now, My Lord, I shall set the wheels in
motion at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings bowed, as did Jack. As they
would have passed out of the Czar’s presence, the
latter exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pray extend my condolences to your wounded
second officer, My Lord. Tell him how sorry I am
that he should have been injured in my service.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It shall be done, your Majesty,” replied Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later the commander of the D-17
and his first officer were in the street.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where now, sir?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To the hospital, to see how Frank is getting
on,” replied Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>They turned their steps in that direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Jack had returned to Frank after his
futile chase of Count Blowinski, he found his friend
trying to sit up, and groaning feebly. Jack hurried
to his side and raised Frank’s head to his knee. An
examination showed him that the back of his chum’s
head had been badly cut by coming in contact with
the sharp table edge as he had fallen. The wound
was an ugly one and Jack was much concerned.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Frank would not hear of Jack carrying him
away until he had also looked after the stranger
who had so kindly come to their assistance. Jack
did this and found that the man was not badly hurt.
After the lad had sprinkled a little water over his
face, he revived, sat up and directly got to his feet.
Then he lent a helping hand in carrying Frank to
the street. Here Jack stood guard while the man
summoned an ambulance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack climbed in the ambulance with his wounded
chum and went to the hospital. The stranger declined
to go along and took his departure. At the
hospital, Jack saw his friend made comfortable,
learned from the attending physician that the wound
was not dangerous, and then hastened to report to
Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings was much put out to learn that
Frank had been hurt and he upbraided Jack for
putting their lives in jeopardy. Nevertheless, he
realized the gravity of the fact that Count Blowinski
was again at large and had hurriedly sought
an audience with the Czar, where we found the
two British officers at the opening of this chapter.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were admitted to the hospital immediately
and the nurse told them they could see Frank if
he were not sleeping. She was gone a few moments
and returned with the information that he
was awake and anxious to see them. The two made
their way to Frank’s side quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank smiled feebly as Lord Hastings sat down
on the side of the bed and took his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you feel?” demanded the commander
gravely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank smiled a trifle at the apparent anxiety of
his commander. His head was swathed in bandages
and he looked almost ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I don’t feel like going for a joy ride,”
he replied with an attempt at levity, “but I could
feel a whole lot worse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Head pain you much?” asked Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, sir; not much. I know I’ve got a hole
there, but it doesn’t feel like a very big one. Pretty
sharp table in the count’s house, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must have been, to lay you out like that,”
agreed Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it hadn’t been for that, I would have been
in at the finish,” said Frank. “By the way, have
you discovered any trace of the count?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not yet; but by this time the Czar has given
orders to scour the city and it is only a question
of time until the count is apprehended.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope they get him, sir; and still, I would like
to be there when they do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You won’t be,” declared Lord Hastings grimly.
“From present indications you will be here for the
next three or four days. After this I am going to
keep a closer eye on you. You two are too valuable
officers for the king to lose; and that’s just
what will happen unless I tie a string to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I guess you won’t do that, sir,” smiled
Frank. “You wouldn’t like to be tied down, sir.
Neither do we.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, perhaps I won’t do quite that bad,”
said Lord Hastings; “but I am free to tell you that
right now that is just exactly what I feel like
doing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The conversation was continued for some moments
longer; in fact, until the nurse approached
and told Lord Hastings and Jack that they had
talked long enough and that she would have her
patient kept awake no longer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank protested at first, but Lord Hastings silenced
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you don’t keep quiet,” he said, “we won’t
be permitted to see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll be quiet then and go to sleep,” Frank decided.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings and Jack took their leave and
made their way to the quarters in the palace placed
at their disposal by command of the Czar himself.
Ten minutes after their arrival there they were
abed and fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed that they had hardly closed their eyes
when they were awakened by a loud rapping at the
door. Both were on their feet instantly, and Lord
Hastings called out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“His Majesty’s compliments, sir, and he would
like to have you come to him at once—both of
you,” came a voice from without.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell His Majesty that we shall obey his summons
instantly,” Lord Hastings made reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>There came the sound of footsteps retreating
down the hall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wonder what the Czar wants, sir?” asked Jack
excitedly, as he dressed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t any idea,” returned his commander.
“But certainly it must be something important for
him to summon us thus in the middle of the night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quarter after one, sir,” he said. “Yes, it must
be something important.” He paused, struck by a
sudden thought. “By Jove, sir! Maybe Count
Blowinski has been captured.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pshaw!” said Lord Hastings. “That is hardly
possible. They can’t have been looking for him
more than a couple of hours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And still that may be it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh yes, it may be, but I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But as it developed Jack’s guess had been correct.</p>

<p class='c004'>For, when they were ushered into the Czar’s
presence once more, the first figure upon which
their eyes rested was that of the count himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove! you were right,” said Lord Hastings
in an aside to Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad smiled but said nothing aloud. To himself,
however, he remarked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Another of those things Frank calls hunches.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar greeted them with a smile. In spite
of the lateness of the hour, the Czar was as fully
dressed as when they left him earlier in the night
and he had the appearance of not having retired.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My Lord and Mr. Templeton,” said the Czar,
“I see that you have recognized our friend in the
corner there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings and Jack nodded and the Czar
continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“We were fortunate enough to come upon him
almost at once; and I’ll wager, My Lord, that you
have no idea where we found him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar paused, apparently awaiting an answer.
Lord Hastings shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, your Majesty, I haven’t the slightest idea,”
he returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the Czar, “what will you say when
I tell you that the good count was caught in the
act of trying to break into the palace?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Into the palace!” repeated Lord Hastings in the
greatest surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly,” returned the Czar with a smile. “It
seems that he had still further designs on my life.
Am I not right, my dear Count?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to Count Blowinski with a pleasant
smile on his features.</p>

<p class='c004'>The count glowered at him angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, it’s true,” he shouted. “And if you weren’t
so cowardly that you keep yourself so well guarded,
I would have reached you. I have not given up
hope yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you may as well, Count,” was the reply.
“After this morning at daybreak, I promise you
you will worry about me no more. As Siberia is
too small to hold you, I must take other means to
insure my own safety. No, Count, after this night
you will trouble no one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The count growled under his breath, but he
made no audible response to the Czar’s words, although
he must have realized what the Russian
monarch meant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” said the Czar, “I wouldn’t be surprised
if the count would tell us just how he managed
to escape from Siberia—the bourne from which a
traveler seldom returneth. I am curious.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall tell you nothing,” declared the count
decidedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come, come, Count!” exclaimed His Majesty.
“Surely you will not be so selfish. On my word,
I am curious to know. Pray enlighten my curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Count Blowinski looked at the Czar long and
earnestly; and at last he replied with a shrug of
his shoulders:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, well, I cannot see that it will make much
difference. It will get one of your most trusted
officers into trouble, but he is loyal to you, so I
should be glad to implicate him. In the first place,
then, I never went to Siberia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As I expected,” Lord Hastings interrupted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Continue,” said the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well. The officer in whose command I
was placed chanced to be an old friend—a young
man, rather, who had served under me and had
come to think of me highly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The more fool he,” the Czar interrupted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So you may think. At any rate, he did not believe
the charges against me, apparently plain
though they were. I played upon his credulity to
such an extent that he at last agreed to allow me to
escape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As I suspected,” Lord Hastings interrupted a
second time; and a second time the Czar exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Continue, Count.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was easily arranged,” the count went on.
“One night, while the camp slept, this officer came
to my prison tent—we had not yet started for
Siberia—unbound me, gave me one of his own
uniforms and permitted me to go free. I walked
out boldly and without being accosted. I immediately
left Moscow and came to St. Petersburg—I
should say Petrograd—where I have remained
unrecognized until I was seen by these two English
upstarts in a restaurant to-night. That is all there
is to the story.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Plainly and briefly told, Count,” said the Czar
approvingly. “You may be pleased to know, perhaps,
that you shall leave my Empire as quickly
and as satisfactorily.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean?” questioned the count, raising an
eyebrow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly,” replied the Czar significantly. “In
the morning at daybreak.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Count Blowinski shrugged his shoulders disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not afraid,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” returned the Czar. “To your credit, I
am glad to say that for you. You have been my
friend, and in spite of the manner in which you
have betrayed me, I am glad to know that you
are not a coward. I hope you shall bear up bravely
under the ordeal.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You need have no fear,” said the count with a
bow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” said the Czar.</p>

<p class='c004'>He signaled the officer of the guard in charge
of the prisoner. “Take him away!” he exclaimed.
“Guard him carefully and at daybreak to-morrow—I
should say this morning—take a squad, of soldiers,
stand the count against the wall and shoot him.
It is time he was put out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Count Blowinski did a sudden and audacious
thing. At the Czar’s last words, and before
any man present could raise a hand to stop him, the
count leaped forward; and as he did so his hand
dropped to his belt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And it is time you were put out of the way,
too!” he cried.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <br />DEATH OF THE TRAITOR—OLD ENGLAND AGAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Czar Nicholas shrank back.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the hand of Count Blowinski, which flashed
aloft above his head, a knife gleamed in the light.
A cry of horror went up from those in that part
of the room who were so far back as to preclude
a possibility of their being able to interfere in time
to save the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Those closer to the Czar hurled themselves forward;
but they had hesitated a moment when the
count sprang forward and they too would have been
too late.</p>

<p class='c004'>In all that room, among the score of officers and
soldiers, there was only a single soul who had the
presence of mind, the courage and the alertness
to act in time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack sprang forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of the fact that Count Blowinski had
seemed, apparently, resigned to his fate, there was
something in the man’s eye that had warned Jack
and told him to be on his guard.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even as he leaped Jack knew he was taking a
desperate chance. The thought flashed through his
mind that even he would be too late to save the
Czar. But there was not a moment of hesitation;
not a second of indecision on his part.</p>

<p class='c004'>Straight between the Czar and Count Blowinski
Jack sprang, at the same time raising a hand to
catch the upraised arm, the hand of which grasped
the knife in a firm grip.</p>

<p class='c004'>But in his haste the lad had not gauged the
distance accurately. True he had interposed his
body between that of the Czar and the would-be
assassin, but he failed to grasp the upraised arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>The moment that he realized he had missed, Jack
swerved a bit, and the knife, descending, slashed his
right shoulder. Had he not swerved it had been
his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before Count Blowinski could move to strike
again, Jack, whirling suddenly, seized the arm in
his left hand and clung to it tightly, his now useless
right arm hanging by his side.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar was safe.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a cry of baffled rage, Count Blowinski gave
a desperate wrench and freed himself from the
lad’s grasp.</p>

<p class='c004'>With his eyes red with rage, he again raised the
knife and cried out at Jack:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now die!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The knife descended, but even as it would have
found its mark, it fell clattering to the floor as a
revolver shot rang out.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once, twice, Count Blowinski spun round on his
heel, made a desperate effort to keep his feet; then
plunged to the floor on his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a breathless silence in the room as
Jack moved forward, turned the count over on his
back and laid a hand over his heart. Then he
looked up and said quietly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad got to his feet and turned to Lord
Hastings, who still held a smoking revolver in his
hand—it was he who had fired the shot that had
saved Jack’s life.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You, sir——” he began, then staggered, and
before Lord Hastings could raise a hand to catch
him, pitched forward across the body of the count.</p>

<p class='c004'>Instantly the Czar became greatly excited. He
waved his arms above his head and cried out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Summon my physician immediately! Hurry!
What is the matter with you? Can’t you see this
lad is in need of immediate assistance?	My
physician! Quickly!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Instantly all became confusion. Men rushed out
the door, treading upon each other’s feet and
jostling one another furiously in their effort to
obey the Czar’s command.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings and the Czar sprang to Jack’s side
at the same moment, but it was the Russian ruler
who raised the lad’s head to his knee and placed a
hand over the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>The effort was rewarded by a slight beating.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He lives!” cried the Czar. “Some water
quickly!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings sprang to obey this command and
soon the Czar himself was bathing Jack’s face and
talking to him, as would a father to a son who was
ill.</p>

<p class='c004'>And at last Jack opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar breathed a sigh of great relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank God!” he exclaimed fervently.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings also now stooped over Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you feel, Jack?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack smiled up at him feebly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shoulder hurts considerably, sir,” he replied,
and winced with the pain. “Foolish of me to
topple over like this, though, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Foolish!” repeated the Czar, and then sprang
to his feet and exclaimed excitedly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“My doctor! My doctor! Where is he? Doesn’t
the man have sense enough to hurry? By my soul,
I’ll have him sent to Siberia if he is not here in
two minutes!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And His Majesty continued to rave until a few
moments later a little man hurried in briskly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where have you been?” exclaimed the Czar.
“Don’t you know enough to hurry when I send for
you? See to this boy at once. At once, do you
hear?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The physician paid no attention to the Emperor
of all the Russians more than to push His Majesty
aside as he said shortly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stand back, now, all of you and give me
room.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Not another man was there in all the empire
who could speak to the Czar like that.</p>

<p class='c004'>He took no heed of any of those standing about,
except to give an occasional order as he worked;
and after ten minutes he looked up at the Czar and
said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no danger, sire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank God!” exclaimed the Czar again. “I will
not have him die. He shall have the best that the
Empire affords. Have him taken to my own suite
immediately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And the Czar would hear of nothing else. Lord
Hastings he commanded to be his guest in the
palace and the latter could do naught but comply.</p>

<p class='c004'>And so, for the next three days, Jack lay ill in
the Czar’s palace. Daily he grew stronger, for he
was of a vigorous and healthy constitution and
after the first day there was absolutely no danger.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a dismal time for Lord Hastings, who
now had both of his officers on the sick list; and
the commander of the D-17 divided his time
between the sick room in the Czar’s palace and the
hospital, where Frank was confined.</p>

<p class='c004'>But at last the time came when the physician
decided that Jack could get up and move about a
little. This was indeed welcome news to Jack,
who insisted, the first day he was out of bed, upon
being taken to see Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, as he greeted his chum with
outstretched hand, “it seems that if I get into a
little trouble, you must do likewise.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s not the reason I did it,” was the reply.
“Say, we’re a couple of fine officers for King
George, aren’t we? We’re always in trouble of
some kind. The first thing you know, he’ll be asking
for our resignations.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I guess not,” said Lord Hastings, who had
overheard this remark. “However, I am greatly
afraid that I am going to lose you both.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Going to lose us?” repeated Jack in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean, sir?” demanded Frank
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” said Lord Hastings, “I shall have to
report your conduct to His Majesty, King George,
and when I do——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I told you,” broke in Jack. “His Majesty will
ask us to resign.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By George! I hope not,” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And when I do,” continued Lord Hastings, not
heeding the interruptions, “I shall probably lose
you both, for His Majesty probably will take you
away from me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What for, sir?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” was the reply, “His Majesty will realize,
as I have long ago, that you are too valuable officers
to be fooling around as lieutenants. You will
probably get the promotions you both deserve.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack and Frank fell suddenly silent. They had
thought of nothing like this. But after some moments
Frank said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, sir, if there is any danger of such a
catastrophe, I hope that you will be kind enough
to say nothing to the king.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Frank is right, sir,” agreed Jack. “It would
indeed be a catastrophe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would be a catastrophe for me if I were to
lose you,” said Lord Hastings very quietly.</p>

<hr class='c006' />

<p class='c004'>As the days passed the injuries of both lads
healed rapidly. At the end of a week both were
feeling perfectly fit and each expressed his earnest
desire to put to sea again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not until you are absolutely fit,” was Lord
Hastings’ decision. “You must remember that we
face a dangerous task passing through the Kiel
Canal on the way home and I want you both to be
absolutely in ship-shape before I attempt it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve gone through three times now,” said
Jack quietly. “I guess we can manage it once
more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And going back,” said Lord Hastings, “we shall
go as we came this last time—with no stops and
no thought of engaging a single one of the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, sir——” began Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are no ‘buts’ in this case,” declared Lord
Hastings with finality. “I’m the commander of
the D-17, and what I say goes, if I have to put
you both in irons to keep you quiet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Lord Hastings took this tone, both lads
knew there was no use of arguing the matter; and
while both felt they would like to strike another
blow at the German fleet on their homeward journey,
they were forced to accept Lord Hastings’
dictum.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length the day for leaving came; but before
they could go aboard the D-17, at the Czar’s command,
they needs must dine with him. This they
did, and in the presence of the many notables who
sat down to table, the Czar, following the feast,
arose and complimented each lad separately and
highly.</p>

<p class='c004'>And he closed with this injunction:</p>

<p class='c004'>“If, at any time, during the war or after peace
has come to bless our several lands, you should
chance to be in Russia, either of you, and you fail
to come to me before another, I promise you that
I shall seek you out and have you sent to Siberia
for life—that I may see you whenever I lose my
sense of what is right and wrong and need something
to set me right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Czar finished his remarks amid tremendous
applause, much to the embarrassment of the two
lads, who stood there, faces flushed and grinning
foolishly. But the banquet came to an end at last
and Lord Hastings, Frank and Jack took their
departure, the praises of the Czar still ringing in
their ears.</p>

<p class='c004'>They went aboard the D-17 the same night and
made ready for their departure in the morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as the D-17 steamed slowly along on the
surface the following morning, what a terrible din
and roar there was, as every Russian ship of war
in the harbor fired a farewell salute!</p>

<p class='c004'>Said Lord Hastings to his two officers:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may live many, many years, but it will be
long ere you will have the honors heaped upon you
that you have earned in Russia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no reply that either lad could make,
so they stood silently on the bridge, watching the
city of Petrograd disappear in the distance; and
presently they came once more to the broad expanse
of the Baltic.</p>

<p class='c004'>The journey back to the shores of old England
was without a single incident to mar its
peacefulness. They passed through the Kiel Canal without
going to the surface, nor were they disturbed by
a foe in the depths. The mines they steamed by
safely also, and soon they once more found themselves
under the protection of the great British
fleet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings immediately ran for London; and
six hours after the D-17 had docked there, the
lads found themselves once more in Lord Hastings’
palatial home. And Lady Hastings took them both
by the arms and addressed them thus:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know how fond I have grown of you two
boys. You have been away long and I have missed
you. This time, I shall keep you with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As Frank and Jack blushed and bowed and
scraped uncomfortably, Lord Hastings only smiled
and nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Lady Hastings quietly, “you have
done much for England, all three of you boys,”
and she glanced affectionately at her husband.
“Now, for a time, you shall take orders from no
one but me. You shall all stay here and rest!”</p>
